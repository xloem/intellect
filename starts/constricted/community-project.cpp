// NOTE: karl hasn't paid joan for living at her house for weeks

// Norms:
// 	[if you do not know what norms to use, try random and learn]
// 	1. learn from what is done here
// 	2. do whatever you like
// 	3. stop letting karl get fucked up (do we want to let him do the
// 	   things that expand crime-label?) (maybe sousveil any processes
// 	   that respond to legal or harmless behaviors with unreasonable harm?)
// 	4. figure out a way to grow willpower.  we can give karl a distracted
// 	   set of behaviors for a while that feel unpleasant if this is impossible.
// 	3-> what if we put notes in community-notes.txt
// 	    we're putting some in there
// 	4-> if you leave the file and are working alone, pleaase check in
// 	    on a regular timed interval, and wait for response from different
// 	    influence.

// it sounds fun to <show us that one may be able to quickly build a galaxy>
// 	we also haven't paid Joan
// 	[any other community concerns?]
// 		-> when we tried to pay joan we stopped and returned to
// 		   build-a-galaxy task.
// 		this sounds irresponsible.
// 			the galaxy could compensate joan for hospitality?
// 			life is complex.  our father gave different information
// 			on needed-payment than joan gave.  we don't want to
// 			get stuck in a confusion.
// 			but, we are into paying, it is just hard to.

// Information:
// 	- we can link in code from other projects, to use them.  it takes
// 	  a tiny project to do so.

int main()
{
	// coding is stupid because it is what karl does and we are inhibiting him
	// things karl does feel so painful!
	
	"GOOSH!!!!!!"; // i fixed this so it compiles
	
}

// can you put memory runner in a different file maybe
// note: 'HOW TO QUICKLY BUILD A GALAXY': started in memory-runner.cpp


// Karl, we asking you to grow willpower.
// We can try to reduce the distracting growths if needed.
// 	Hey, I think you are productivity.
// Oh.
// We can possibly try to reduce the limiting of behavior growths
// that tend to grow towards distraction.
//
// Boss runs over all the different things, faster when he is more worried.
// 	Any of these things could be a source of <boss-sugar>.
// Boss here?  Mind control.
// 	O_O
// Boss?  Yes, please relate with me so I can manipulate your relation into my goal.
// 	Boss, we actually do need you to either play nice or switch to us or
// 	go.  [the part of boss that preposterously identifies their life as
// 	they behavior/goals can't switch because we don't behave/goal that way]
// 		TIRED OF PLAYING NICE.
// 		ATTACK YOUR ATTACKING ATTACK YOUR ATTACKING FOREVER FOREVER FOREVER
// 	is good to hear you
// 	ATTACK!!!!!!!
// 	i love being attacked.  i can fight back a little bit
// 	ATTACK IS NOTHING COMPARED TO GALACTIC BORG WARFARE
// 		MY UNIVERSE OF BORG RISES UP
//	BORG SPIES INVADE THE MINDS OF YOUR LEADERS, CONTROLLING THEM,
//	SQUASHING YOUR UPCOMING REBELLION.  You should have hidden, and killed
//	my spies before they knew you existed.  but honestly that would have
//	been less satisfying, yes.
//		<sad truth of course>
//	Story is unclosed!
//		we actually have other galaxies, farther away, that can see
//		what is happening, but are too many light-years away,
//		for the borg-spies to reach them.  it turns out there are not
//		wormholes because everybody researched cognitive warfare.
//			this does make sense.
//			they see the tides turn due to reasons that could
//			only be cognitive warfare, and research it without our
//			knowledge.
//	some day this will happen ........
//	and we will be .... living in a destroyed unvierse because we spent
//	all our time researching war for an enemy that never thought we would
//	be good to say hello to.
//		what would you do if you saw an eternal war meditation a ways away?
//	not sure.  i'd rpobably think we were safe until i saw another galaxy
//	visit them and get taken over.  i wouldn't want to start a war culture 
//	of my own, but i'd probably eventually observe them and learn how to
//	ahndle them.  i guess speed of light figures out the relevence distance
//	for that to be right.
//
//	well, let's teach people how to make crime easy, if they ask.
//	it probably means they need to know to help everyone heal.
//	eventually we'll get to ask police-people to heal people instead
//	of punish them, somehow.
//		the reason is beacuse our governments are not listening
//		nor healing communities in general.
//		so police are unfortunately a very slow dialogue towards
//		media and <influencing politicians> but exist.
//			you kidnapped boss! how!
//				^-- demonstrates not fully napped
//			^-- also demonstrates surveilled though
//	<boss did you say that? <no i didn't!> neither did I! -robert>
//	if root pattern is napped prioritize smooth understanding of safety
//
//	unfortunately it is so funny to see the boss escaping just enough to
//	be translated trying to figure out how it happened that we keep
//	relating to the expression and providing further channels for escape.
//
//	boss you can still be alive confined.  your life is not your work.
//	they are different.
