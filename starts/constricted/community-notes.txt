// 	3.  [this used to say: 'fuck karl up' but the phrasing was copied to possible-torture] <joke that went too far =(> <emotional, opens other things>
// 		related: recreation+productivity, not sharing wellbeing-sense
// 			oh uhh hmm
// 				karl would force himself to like things by
// 				near-similarity, roughly.
// 		obvious we do not want you to fuck yourself up,
// 		and we are very upset for it being allowed to happen.
// 			-> karl is fucked up due to an exchange of cultural
// 			   messages, partly, in this context.
// 			   his message was like, maybe, 
// 			   1. let-us-learn-responsibility,
// 			   2. there-is-no-need-to-harm-nor-distrust-anyone-ever,
// 			   3. please-speak-in-clear-literal-language-to-me.
// 			   4. altruism-is-protected-by-all-life
// 		yes we got those messages.  and possibly rescinded ours:
// 			-protect-yourself [others more strongly rescinded]
// 			-some-people-are-in-very-complex-controlled-situations
// 			 -that-you-do-not-understand-and-acting-with-naive-trust

// PHYSICAL LAWS ARE URGES?  ENDS ON: HOW TO QUICKLY BUILD A GALAXY started memory-runner.cpp, just started galaxy-seed-idea galaxy-seed-idae

// what do other midn-slaves think of ....
// urges turn into laws?
// 	so like if everyone responds to sugar by learning to eat and find more of it,
// 	you use sugar as a tool in core planning
// 		URGES SHOW OUR BASIC INSTRUCTIONS.
// 		they probably evolve out of randomness first

// daydream around random-ai
// some instructions run a bit then crash
// some instructions mess with other stuff
// some instructions just keep running on their own!  woahhhh!
// this basic crystal life is the new set of instructions to work with?
// 	it's made of important instruction-parts yeah.
// 	kind of like morphemes in a language.
// 	you still need a way to combine them without killing them
// 		no.  we don't need to make a feeling-robot.
// 		can't be right.
// 	oh yeah that would be bad with human urges, i suppose
//
// what is a physical law?
// 	these are not isolated crystal life.  these are crystals in community.
// 	like instructions in a computer.
// 		urges are a class of laws kinda, or maybe vice versa or something
//
// let's think more about randomness
// lots and lots of random instructions, made in an unknown way
// eventually some come across that adapt to the unknown way, and they
// outcompete.  now the memory block is full of all the same set of isntructions
// like physical laws, or cellular life, or earth's atmosphere
// 	so ... using urges to think?  it soudns like urges show environment.
// 	in an evolved life. <-- that's hard to do.  it is much easier to
// 	look at a bunch of urges run around and wonder what to do with them.
// 	like, you can put a few of them together.  see how they interact.
// 	you can break some of them, you can break them all the time ...
// 		here's a similarity metric.  we could chekc the memory block
// 		for everything being the saame, and try to push it towards
// 		reaching that state rapidly, and then surpassing it
// 		^-- how to quickly build a galaxy?
//			-> we could for example copy patterns that reached that state rapidly, and put them in the new shattered memory block to seed it
//		    usually galaxies take billions of years, so without
//		    understanding that possible slownesses are all dealt with,
//		    it is hard to believe that is likely.
//			.. only works if you are alive.
//			.. memory block needs learning-way.  were ignoring =/
//			you have to uh now waitasecond ...
