// LET'S USE THE TRAUMA THERAPY INTELLECT APPROACH.
// The core is that we focus our energy on handling our failures.
// This can involve taking the time to understand them, or entering a trauma state and asking the user for help.
// 	Trauma state must be logged.  Solution must be stored.  Can just be creation of a trauma-handling pattern, I suppose.
// 	Understanding will likely involve breaking behavior into steps
// 		maybe then backtracking from a failure to the steps that caused it, and opening those steps up into substeps

// GDB HAS A MACHINE INTERFACE MODE THAT COULD BE USED TO MANAGE EXECUTION WITH LEARNING
// It likely also handles segfaults.

#include "Context.hpp"

// let's launch a context func providing for segfault handling <===========================
// 1. fork into two processes.  old process waits on status of new
// 2. new process makes call.  if call succeeds, reports to old who disappears knowing shared
//    state is fully held by new.
// 3. if call fails, old holds state, and reports trauma to user
// 		concepts: "how do i handle this"
// 		          "do i understand this correctly"
// 		          "why did this happen"


///// CORE
// brainstorm on brainstorming
// define brainstorming as 2 patterns:
// - a large scale goal
// - a habit implementation made of interconnecting steps
//
// use brainstorming on the two to find better and better ways and implementations.

////// Should I make an AI?
// Assuming you want to SHARE it, YES.
// Until you make an AI, only a handful of select people on earth will have one.
// These people will be effectively running the world, leaving many concerns out.
// They have a head start on you, so it is likely only possible if you don't harm them in the work.

///// Core expansion
// need step-concept, made of substeps, with state-parts that interconnect?
// 		need state-concept
// currently working on steps having behavior -- runtime libs

// could state concept evolve via interconnection of steps and checking?
// 	maybe?  looks hard

// I'm thinking about implementating brainstorm-about-brainstorm
// and how this will require process-step- and goal- patterns, and that they
// will be interchangeable, roughly.
//
// Thinking of matching parts of nested pattern contexts ...
// this is similar to the 'grounded' patterns in opencog
// each [context layer] has a [variable-set layer] associated with it --
// variables of that layer depend on the context layer
// 	each one is one pattern

// let's do an example of simple step task.
// - make toast
// 	get bread
// 		open cupboard
// 		remove bag-of-bread
// 		open bag-of-bread
// 		take bread out of bag-of-bread
// 		place bread on counter
// 		close bag-of-bread
// 		return bag-of-bread to cupboard
//		close cupboard
// 	toast bread into toas
// 	butter toas
// 	serve
// make toast
// 	goal: toasted bread for eating
// 	start: in kitchen, human
//
//open cupboard
//	goal: cupboard-contents-accessible
//	start: cupboard closed
//	way: reach-for-cupboard-and-pull-handle-towards-you
//
//		we open the cupboard so as to access the contents inside of it
//		these contents include the bread we are trying to get
//
//	start:
//	var X
//		where X is in cupboard
//	x cannot be gotten
//
//	end:
//	var X
//		where X is in cupboard
//	x can be gotten
//
//	always:
//	var X, Y, Z
//		where X is in Y
//		and Y is in Z
//	X is in Z

// there's a connection between layers here.  we moved from 'make toast' to 'get bread'
// with 'bread is in cupboard' implicit

// goal: have toast
// know: using toaster, bread becomes toast
// do not have bread
// find X: pre: do not know where X is. post: know where X is
// get X: pre: do not have X. post: have X

// available steps:
// open-cupboard: X is in cupboard and you can't get X, now you can get X

// what connects get-bread to can-get-bread?
// how is opening the cupboard the first step for getting the bread?
// get-bread means pick-up-bread-physically
// pick-up-bread-physically requires air-path-to-object
// cupboard prevents this
// can-pick-up-bread-bag

// okay, need-bread:
// bread-is-in-bread-bag -> can get things inside other things via opening
// need bread-bag
// bread-bag-is-in-cupboard -> can get things inside other things via opening


// end-state: have-bread

// step: get X
// start-state: X is reachable,
// [reach to get]
// end-state: have X
//
// apply step to end-state: have-bread.  now we want end-state: bread is reachable.

// step: open Y
// start-state: X is in Y
//              Y is reachable
//              Y is openable 
// [act to open Y]
// end-state: X is reachable

// so if we are working on end-state: have-bread
// we are probably using a general pattern where 'bread' is held by a variable we have.
// we're given our context to include this variable, when we brainstorm solutions.
// in our brainstorm, we look for things that could move towards our end-state.
// we plug in data related to our context to make this work.
// bread is what we want a path to have, so when we see a pattern with 'have X' at end,
// we plug 'bread' in for X.
// we know thing sabout 'bread', so we can plug 'bread is in bread bag' in for 'X is in Y'
// 	or if we don't know whether bread is in bread bag, we can leave that piece
// 	of the pattern unknown, and try it to see if it works.

// it doesn't seem that complicated or that confusingly nested, because the inner patterns
// have their outer context filled when evaluated.

// to reiterate the reminder, this is very logical and is not the only way for thought
// and learning.  we will need a fuzziness to it and to be able to morph it around.
// [using e.g. openiness yes rather than 'is it reachable is it openable']
// so more like
// step: open Y
// end-state: sometimes X is now reachable
//	and relations between X and Y affect the likelihood of that


// THEN: rather than listing these steps out, just give some experiences
// and then brainstorm the similarities among the experiences
// to identify proposed patterns
// that can be used to do stuff.
// 	TODO: lay out precise brainstorming pattern for 1st-stage pattern-generalizing

//		1st stage is not too hard (but insufficient in long term)
//
//		cupboard is closed
//		then
//		[wayne opens cupboard]
//		then
//		wayne has bread
//	becomes pattern proposal for open-cupboard as listed above

// PLUS: To quickly fill in the unexpected gaps:
// 	if you have all the bits in, it should be able to derive general wisdom
// 	without exploring reality. (of course reality is needed to check this)

// ALSO ALSO ALSO: be sure to consider the attribute-patterns.
// opening some A works for getting some B
// 	-> there are discernable patterns available here regarding
// 		B is in A
// 		A is openable
// 		A is reachable

// COMMUNITY: cooperate with peers to accomplish goals.  both like you, and unlike you.
// 	map similarity between the structures of interacting with peers, and internal
// 	structures.

// AFTER YOU CAN THINK RELIABLY:
// 	when you find a good choice, be sure to use it to research how to make the bad
// 		choice just as good. ((all things have inherent value))


// be sure to generalize patterns and pattern work,w/ simple processes that work for many forms

// CUR TASK: send and receive a simple goal with habit to reach goal
// this is a subtask of process optimization
// it is communication between subprocesses
//
// 	goal: communicate with other process
// 	
// 	pre:
// 	$x is a process
// 	$y is a process
// 	$z is information
// 	$x knows $z
// 	$y does not know $z
//
//	post:
//	$y knows $z
//
//	habit: <code reference>
//
// we'll need a step reserializer.
// 	way to merge serialization and deserialization?
// 		1. form patterns mapping between the two
// 		2. make a general reserialization process that makes the missing pattern exist
// 			<let's keep send/recv separate for now, but make this for
// 			 line-meaning>

// CORE ROLES:
// 	- group learning: research how to research stuff
// 	- diversity: brainstorm new parts of learning to be researched
// 	- implement processes researching the parts of learning brainstormed
//
