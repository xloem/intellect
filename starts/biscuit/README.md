# How To Make An Intelligence

The key part of intelligence is a process that designs, improves, learns from, and understands itself and others like it.  That is, a process that works with how processes work.

On a computer, processes are made of instructions: steps.  Working with a process means
being able to represent possible steps as some kind of structured data that can be executed.
The data structure must represent enough meaning to interconnect the steps to do something,
and it must be able to refer to itself usefully.

1. Choose a simple algorithm for collecting steps together to perform a task.
2. Choose a simple representation of steps to use for #1.
3. Implement #2 enough to use it to communicate a step to another process.
Once #3 works, the goal now is to efficiently produce a form of #1 as a collection of
processes that can develop themselves, using each other as their steps.  Make sure to
reuse your work, and do work that is reusable, as much as possible.

4. Choose a simple algorithm for handling if something horrible goes wrong that must
   never be repeated (trauma).  Consider storing a detailed log forever.  Consider refusing to
   continue until enough knowledge is found to prevent it happening again.
	Note: In humans, trauma spreads as urgent habits for handling it.
	This makes war, so if you can identify it is happening, consider that group-trauma.

Below this line is a work in progress.

5. Choose a simple algorithm for testing if #2 is correct.  Use #4 if it is not.
6. Consider that a group of processes is itself a process.  This could be any arbitrary
   group of processes.

Note: each way to do things, is a thing the whole process can do.
