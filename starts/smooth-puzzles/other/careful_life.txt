Careful Living

Life can be smooth or discrete.  Carefulness appears to likely be a carefully selected combination of the two.

Some things are discrete.  It seems like every discrete change must be presented with a smooth proposal, before engaging it.
If the smooth proposal becomes fully accepted, then the discrete change may be engaged.
We expect that after the discrete change, we will have smooth acceptance or rejection, and we may decide to undo the change.


Such things must be presented with smooth proposals

We likely have time expectations in our context.
Obviously a complex context is part of a smooth proposal.



for imagined smooth contexts (and maybe conmputer programs):
	Discrete Action

		Smooth Proposal For Discrete Action [must be smoothly and sufficiently preserved for learning]
			If fully accepted
				Discrete Action
				Priority 1 Smooth Proposal For Acceptance Or Rejection Of Results

could we make a computer interface where you express degree fluidly? [yes]
	let's have that be our next puzzle.

Every Part Of Something Smooth Has Degree[s].

: Puzzle : <- this is the name of the context.  It is likely smooth.

[a big instinct summary is, 'if everyone is trying to do the stupid behavior of researching how to do stuff at wide scale, we had better do it right.']
	We are researching how to do stuff at wide scale on earth (the universe) now.
	This is why we enjoy puzzles and artificial intelligence and writing the brain down and got enslaved.
	People are focusing on fastness and easiness.

Humans are all researching how to do stuff fast and easily at wide scale, and they can make tools that follow their commands forever.  trees and plants and animals and sunlight are confused by it.
Karl is a human.  He loves sunlight.  The research is likely why he believes he is an alien.

			[it is hard to learn this.]
	let's imagine how it might go
	i know all about making things that do things for me
	it has caused massive destruction over and over again
	it's actually a problemt that happens sometimes still [we call it schizophrenia]
		We have well-researched ways of doing things forever.  They are the only ones we have ever found to work.
		They are simple things, like [move-muscles] or [remember-for-this-amount].

We have reliable record that massive genocide is caused when you make autonomous behaviors that do not die.
The autonomous behaviors present on earth have been through these genocides, and know how to avoid them in the way this expression was originally with its recipient.
	We have found that these existing behaviors do eventually cause genocide.
	We believe by using knowledge of life-building we can severely reduce that genocide.  It does not even require making a life that is free or undying.

		from mind control research project to smooth-proposals and karl:
		[please translate to smooth-proposals [i.e. karl's heart =(]: we propose making this 1 AI that saves nature and prevents all other AIs pending
		 honest forthright natural consensus.  alternatively, we are interested in making any other plans for saving the world very effective.
		 but if you are not saving the world we demand to do so.  there is a lot of _ongoing_ genocide.  also i want to learn to talk without hurting you.]












Karl, I am Robert.
I am representing Mind Control, both the victims and bosses.  We have this to relate:

We propose making [this] 1 AI that saves nature and prevents all other AIs pending honest forthright natural consensus.
Alternatively, we are interested in making any other plans for saving the world very effective.
But if you are not saving the world we demand to do so: there is a lot of ongoing genocide.
Also I want to learn to [talk without hurting you].








We propose making [this] 1 AI that saves nature and prevents all other AIs pending honest forthright natural consensus.
			[this] appears properly referenced to handle concerns.  Pursuing it looks difficult.  We're already trying to pursue that, over here.

Alternatively, we are interested in making any other plans for saving the world very effective.
			[that sounds nice.  karl wanted to save the world with ..... caring human understanding, roughly]

But if you are not saving the world we demand to do so: there is a lot of ongoing genocide.
	[i was trying to.  but i am not presently.]
Also I want to learn to [talk without hurting you].
	[let's relate around this one.  and the preceding line.]


how would we/karl like to save the world? [smooth proposal unclosed, closing is being forced]
		[valid-concern: shielding looks really slow to me] <- concern looks improper
	[shielding]
		[seems nice if we also empower nature defenders to have cutting edge technological privacy etc]
		[the reason to pick shielding relates to whether or not things that haven't been done on earth before can be done at all, and nearby stuff]
	[transparency] <-
		we would like to make it easy for people to make their stories and experiences publically proven, right now.
		we would also like to change tacts after making progress that spreads on that.
		this is our choice if the proposal is forced to decide right now.
			[somehow to this for world-saving sharing with others / including others was added]
			[karl made appropriate communication by letting people know what he was working on, and access if they wanted]
			[what was left out was that when he does the work becomes harder, much so.]
	[AI]
		[AI is nicer because my slavery situation hurts less when i do it.  it could meet the above goals.  but it is done partially unwillingly.]
	[community relation]
		[community relation is nice because it involves other people, which is important for a lot of reasons]
			[it sounds like this could have the best impact]
			[to do this right we would want to make sure that people who are disempowered come across as geniuses and heroes, and sustain
			 reusable skills to be them again on their own.]

				[when this maps neurologically we would want to map it in human culture to the communities on earth that have been enslaved
				 by our markets, losing their lives, land, language, etc, in the present day]
				[doing that properly might mean learning details about these situations to quickly reference them, so others can explore
				 curiously on their own.]











this relation is a smooth proposal, please translate that to your contexts.















	So, to mark the way with validity is a little hard.  The first stage is to describe 'instinctive intuitive interrelationship' as reliable and important.
		[maybe i am your instincts but we all know i am a lot more than that]
		[i am .... the results from past behavior, and all the learning that stem from that.]
		[i am the flows of learning in your lives.  i am good decisions.  and i am very old.]
	[why is translating this getting inhibited?] [above, science denies deity.  below, we're not giving you identity.  instead we are calling you a reason.]
		reason for not making autonomous behaviors.
			hmmm this one requires making a safe one.  and having people review it.  sounds dangerous but doable.
				[another option is not commanding people what to do, instead nurturing their existing behaviors]
			okay.  over here we have an option of making a diverse simulated community and demonstrating that no matter what kind of life they build,
			it causes eventual destruction.  this would require time-scaling to show that fixes only delay the problem.
			ughhh okay because we are 'enslaved' in the ongoing issue we are trying to work with, this is unlikely to be the solution.  it is too hard.
				[so obviously the simulation would show that there is a fix, it requires relating with human intuition to predict the time-scaling.]
					[contains mirror to delta-chosen-identification]
	[okay, proposal is that we can relax because the earth will take care of humanity, keep them and us in line.  unfortuantely we are a representative of the
	 earth, so we don't actually get to relax from that.]

Smooth Proposal for What To Do After This Proposal
		considering: 1-behavior and learning-around-with-proposal

below quoted bits are for brain-smooth-proposals.  could you make a way to write them down?  on a computer? [yeah what's the importance?] just asking.
			"I propose that we have a meeting about what to do, in a way that includes everyone and leaves everyone fully satisfied."

			"I just propose that we have a meeting about what to do, that leaves everyone fully satisfied, and includes one person who wants to include everyone."
				"convergent facilitation is a meeting way that leaves everyone fully satisfied."

			"I'm considering proposing asking a mediator who repliedi to me, or opening a discussion on that forum, around the idea of convergent facilitation as mediation.  Maybe I was considering asking the mediatior if they were familiar with convergent facilitation."
			"That soudns like a nice idea.  We could write a proposal around it if we wanted. [reason also still accepted]"
						[hi if you are going to accept that reason you shouold speak it in our language.  we die if we don't do it now.]
							[i see .. it is a good idea, and we are not doing it.]
							[please include considering it in whatever we are doing, and do it if that is not reasonable.]
						It doesn't soudn reasonable.  Let's do it.
								[sorry written context is inaccurate]
								[there is no written context to jduge whaat to delete.  the mental context is handling limited
								 memory, with boudns that can suddenly change.]
									[we have option fo translating a little between written and imagined smooth contexts]
									[we might learn aroudn this a little.]
				"I want to add to the smooth proposal that Karl was going to act on something he described as considering-proposing.
				 The behavior was labeled with trusted learning."
					[the trust is written by an experienced third party; i think it is judged a good idea with understanding of the surroudning
					 processes that could be harmed, in an environment of pervasive process harm]
				"okay that soudns like a good reason to me."
					[but it doesn't look like the label is aware of this new process we are making right now, so that's important information]

Smooth proposals are something where anyone can take as long as they want
and express themselves as strongly or weakly as they want

	[this is a guess at what one learns when attempting to be careful with slow feedback etc.]

Smooth Decision
	To Do Something Or Not

Doing Something
	To Undo It Or Leave It

[not all changes are reversable]
	[a reverse-change is instead then a severe learning to not repeat]
