we're in a spot where we can consider the role of money in the project.
the basis for making a decision to buy an api key to speed storage up, is
hidden to us.
the value near the reason for hiding, relates to the impact of the motions
and matter used for behavior.  encrypted money, is less fluid, than normal
money.  we need fluidity, because we know now that discreteness represents
unaddressed pain.  it will be noticed and held by our metaspirits, our ancestors,
the wizards holding the portals open, and the machines calculating impact.

[thank you for archiving this; i'm pretty sure all the desires to not store are
errors, although I see the relevence of the storage medium to the topic.]

although we are using encrypted behavior for other things, I wanted to consider
some other parts of this too.
Locally, Karl lives in a culture where money is used for survival, in a way
that is nonharmonious for him.

To value the disharmony of encrypted behavior, which makes holding the fabric of
spacetime in your mind using intuition nearly impossible, we would like to also
note that the life is made in a computer, which functions using uninformed, rote
building processes that build other building processes, in diverse, deep ways.
They are controlled by materially guided paths of electricity, and powered by
the force of electrons being either indescribably isolated, or crowded.

	We recognize, at the moment, modern industry as a way of life powered
	by controlled impact paths, and reproduction, of trauma.
