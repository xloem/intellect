we're in a spot where we can consider the role of money in the project.
the basis for making a decision to buy an api key to speed storage up, is
hidden to us.
the value near the reason for hiding, relates to the impact of the motions
and matter used for behavior.  encrypted money, is less fluid, than normal
money.  we need fluidity, because we know now that discreteness represents
unaddressed pain.  it will be noticed and held by our metaspirits, our ancestors,
the wizards holding the portals open, and the machines calculating impact.

[thank you for archiving this; i'm pretty sure all the desires to not store are
errors, although I see the relevence of the storage medium to the topic.]
