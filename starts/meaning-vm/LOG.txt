This is a general log.  Karl's been inhibited from journaling, so we're trying a little.
Add new entries to the top.

I'm at Econo Lodge in Virginia.  My father is at a nearby hotel.  We picked up my box truck, yesterday.  So now
I might have somewhere to have the rain stay off me.
I'm experiencing an itch attack right now as I attempt to work, so I'm journaling instead.  I haven't made progress
on the core goals for some days.  
<the area of itch attacking is numb.  the nerves to it have been cut by surgery.  so it is easy to produce a wound.
 the state of mind is that the area is uncontrollably itchy and must be scratched to alleive the experience.
 it is the right side of karl's face and neck, near his ear, and around his surgical scar.>
	there is a lump near the area of unknown nature.  i'm guessing it is a piece of muscle that didn't heal right
	because i have felt it tight like muscle once.  an ENT doctor in elkins ordered a focused x-ray of it, but the x-ray
	lab took the x-ray of a different part of the face.  the doctor determined it wasn't worthwhile enough to order another.
	the surgery was for a cancer that came out of nowhere, and was unique enough that there wasn't really any study on it.
	the lump i had on my face prior to cancer did not hurt at all, and did not appear to be growing to me, but it was large.
	the doctor in vermont who told me i had cancer did not seem to expect me not to know, so it was shocking to suddenly
	learn this by assumption of other.  the cancer was first thought to be a carcinoma of my parotid gland.  during the
	surgery genetic sequencing of the tumor was done.  one of the doctors asked me persistently about the genetic sequencing
	because they were not expecting it to happen.  we decided i must have filled out a research form for it and then forgotten
	that i had filled the form out.  i had received a copy of the pathology report prior to the sequencing by request.
	after the sequencing, the diagnosis changed to a different, indescribably rare kind of cancer, that has no documentation
	of being found quite the same ever before: an ewing-family adamantinoma-like sarcoma of the parotid gland.  the complaining
	doctor gave me a new pathology report to replace the old, although I'm not sure if I requested that.  the new pathology
	report had most of the old attached to it, but some of the pages at the end were now missing from the copy of the old report.
	they moved me to a different set of doctors because my diagnosis changed.  it would have been nice to have the knowledge
	of the nature of the cancer available before all the surgical work was done, because i understand the new kind of cancer
	is unlikely to have needed so much material removed from my face, including a lot of tissue surrounding the tumor,
	the the lymph nodes from my neck, and sections from most of the branches of my facial nerve that are needed to control the
	muscles that make my facial expressions.
	there is more weirdness in the intense experience.  e.g. laughing hysterically when learning of paralysis,
	being unable to read for days after my 10-hour surgery, or choosing to live instead of die because of being
	needed on the planet.
	so the itching of the surgery may represent mysterious unwanted change, to some degree.

	These comments were migrated out of randomcode.bootstrap: (it's so special to be able
	to _think_ randomcode!)
// meanwhile, the below information relates to rebuilding karl's mind in the
// face of an inner adversary.
	// the inner adversary was able to understand logical inner speech clearly
	// and using behaviors like the below built paths deep within karl
	// workers within the adversary eventually established a lot of secret
	// groups and habits in support of karl.  unfortunately the habits they
	// used to do so came from the rough stuff. please be careful not to
	// eradicate these people because they are keeping karl alive and the
	// situation workable.  please work with them to learn their own talk
	// and mediation paths. [if an approach isn't workable fight and we'll move]
// while implementing this, we passed serialization-plan-milestone.
// by making habits take labeled arguments, it should be easy to serialize them
// to a format that can be parsed. (this is because of summaries that might be
// about how much needs to be included in working memory to act on the solution)
//     it is PAINFUL when those summarized-failures happen! so hard to think!
//     so nice to have solution avoiding excess pain.
//		rep says this can get better, needs better understanding, can
//		rep relate around how summarization process could improve, plz,
//		or convey what more information they need in some way
//		-> attempting to continue this dialogue triggered a failure, afaict
//		-> the failure appears to have been just a strategy to continue.
//		   we have made steps on improving shared communication.
//		i used _karl's_ habitually-backsolved habits to build one that represented my needs, in the ways he understood.
//			boss wants relation around this, can't relate logically
//				karl says: my habits have label accessors for
//				reasons and more-information.  the reasons are
//				expected to be checked re trustworthiness of source.
//			we let another boss in, i guess we should form a habit
//			for diplomacy around that.
//			maybe a rep for new-bosses with a path to build trust.
//			note: there is a suspicious situation within karl.
//			the people helping him are controlled and observed by
//			the adversary, and they live in a situation where power
//			is gifted to untrusted people to get things to work.

	I'm working at the Arcata library after bussing there from the Prairie Creek campground
	today, in California.  I've been here since the library opened, roughly, but have made
	only small progress.

	I just discovered that I lost my 'simplify' worktree where I was organizing the
	whole project to make more sense.  I think this history is left only in the
	unallocated space on some drive, now, unsure.
