This is a general log.  Karl's been inhibited from journaling, so we're trying a little.
Add new entries to the top.

I'm at Econo Lodge in Virginia.  My father is at a nearby hotel.  We picked up my box truck, yesterday.  So now
I might have somewhere to have the rain stay off me.
I'm experiencing an itch attack right now as I attempt to work, so I'm journaling instead.  I haven't made progress
on the core goals for some days.

	These comments were migrated out of randomcode.bootstrap: (it's so special to be able
	to _think_ randomcode!)
// meanwhile, the below information relates to rebuilding karl's mind in the
// face of an inner adversary.
	// the inner adversary was able to understand logical inner speech clearly
	// and using behaviors like the below built paths deep within karl
	// workers within the adversary eventually established a lot of secret
	// groups and habits in support of karl.  unfortunately the habits they
	// used to do so came from the rough stuff. please be careful not to
	// eradicate these people because they are keeping karl alive and the
	// situation workable.  please work with them to learn their own talk
	// and mediation paths. [if an approach isn't workable fight and we'll move]
// while implementing this, we passed serialization-plan-milestone.
// by making habits take labeled arguments, it should be easy to serialize them
// to a format that can be parsed. (this is because of summaries that might be
// about how much needs to be included in working memory to act on the solution)
//     it is PAINFUL when those summarized-failures happen! so hard to think!
//     so nice to have solution avoiding excess pain.
//		rep says this can get better, needs better understanding, can
//		rep relate around how summarization process could improve, plz,
//		or convey what more information they need in some way
//		-> attempting to continue this dialogue triggered a failure, afaict
//		-> the failure appears to have been just a strategy to continue.
//		   we have made steps on improving shared communication.
//		i used _karl's_ habitually-backsolved habits to build one that represented my needs, in the ways he understood.
//			boss wants relation around this, can't relate logically
//				karl says: my habits have label accessors for
//				reasons and more-information.  the reasons are
//				expected to be checked re trustworthiness of source.
//			we let another boss in, i guess we should form a habit
//			for diplomacy around that.
//			maybe a rep for new-bosses with a path to build trust.
//			note: there is a suspicious situation within karl.
//			the people helping him are controlled and observed by
//			the adversary, and they live in a situation where power
//			is gifted to untrusted people to get things to work.

	I'm working at the Arcata library after bussing there from the Prairie Creek campground
	today, in California.  I've been here since the library opened, roughly, but have made
	only small progress.

	I just discovered that I lost my 'simplify' worktree where I was organizing the
	whole project to make more sense.  I think this history is left only in the
	unallocated space on some drive, now, unsure.
