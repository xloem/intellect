	a concept is being deallocated when it is still referenced by a notepad.
	the concept is a subcontext from some habit caller
	its address is 872ed0
	the link-type from the notepad ('ssr') is an anonymous concept with address 7fe230
	the link is straight within the notepad.  not in an imagination.
		maybe this is allocation ownership.
		we added .. uh ..

			we added ... notepads holding ownership of their data.
			so now, when removing them, notepads have the 'allocation' link
			allocation links appear as anonymous because they are below names in the levels
			it wouldn't be hard to name them

	okay .. i gave these concepts a name to aid debugging.
	weirdly, when the error is thrown now, the debugger shows no stack frame.
	i added 'catch throw' and now can see the stack.
	it looks like my guess was correct; the ssr notepad is linked as the allocator for this subcontext 872d60.
