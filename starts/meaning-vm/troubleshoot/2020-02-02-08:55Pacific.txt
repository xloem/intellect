I'm getting on l786 a linebreak being treated as a habit.
Maybe I put a linebreak after a label.  I don't think I accounted for that.
If I switched to a more general way of parsing, these kinds of problems likely
wouldn't happen.  We've been prioritizing get-it-working-now with more imperative
programming, since too much generality builds a complete description of
consciousness in the codebase, roughly.  It's a struggle because I am used
to coding generally.  Coding generally means you don't see progress for a longer
time, while general patterns are built.
08:59 with some debugging and inspection I found it is indeed due to a linebreak
after a label.  The label is args-done in make-random-habit.  Implementing fix.
09:00 thinking about this, I'm realizing a good fix would be to handle all \n's
as nonwords inside lists.  thinking ... which parts are treated that way.
	it turns out we only care about \n's after habit arguments.  so \n should
	only be a word after habit arguments.  changing that would mean adding
	small new structure to our parsing generality, which is inhibited,
	so I'll just handle \n's after labels and such manually.
09:03 i found label handling and it looks like the problem shouldn't happen atm,
reviewing
09:05 my error; the working code is for jumping to labels not specifying them.
09:08 I added manual struts for some linebreaks including the error one.  compilation is ongoing.
09:10 while running the test i reviewed battery situation; laptop only says is using around
1.288A, not 1.6, but doesn't include what it needs to run, nor what is taken from battery.
Sun is giving 1.035A now.
09:12 this error appears resolved.  new error now.  this would be easier if parser were aware
of its line number.
