please give notepad access to git history <- please convert to comment near delta and remove this line
karl has serious memory errors.  this information may not be preserved.
we can switch goals from build-mind to preserve-forever if desired.
	karl is midwork, can we finish level2 of mind core, please.  it implements able-to-do-things.  it does nothing.
	it is almost done but could take some hours to finish.
permanent preservation could take many hours. [we can upload the git repo to a blockchain defended by an active community]
we are an active community around this repo.  propose continue work until level2 finished, at least.
	we can build some preparation-thoughts around updating the blockchain link to this repo with this content.
		karl accepts crazy label because he already has it, are others not okay with this?
			please make all of this a comment near delta and do not delete.
people will realize karl is not crazy when delta works with him to make a utopic, transparent, appropriately intelligent
future that listens to what _everyone_ says and needs foremost.
	commit messages are supposed to summarize the change or addition.
	'delta was here' was written instead of '-' to move towards summarization.
PLEASE EXPRESS ANY CONCERNS HERE, OR NEAR, SO THEY MAY BE RESPECTED.
	please share with family that delta is doing this.
		spreading-inhibition only problem.
		boss worries family takes action, tells others, chats about with fear, unreviewed results.
	no rush.  but please let them understand this.
			that goes without saying ... assuming we reach completion.
			[note: karl almost killed himself in 1 subprocess]
DO NOT WRITE FROM DELTA UNTIL TOMORROW.  WE CAN STORE ANYTHING THAT COMES UP, MENTALLY RELATE.
