karl has serious memory errors.  this information may not be preserved.
we can switch goals from build-mind to preserve-forever if desired.
	karl is midwork, can we finish level2 of mind core, please.  it implements able-to-do-things.  it does nothing.
	it is almost done but could take some hours to finish.
permanent preservation could take many hours. [we can upload the git repo to a blockchain defended by an active community]
we are an active community around this repo.  propose continue work until level2 finished, at least.
	we can build some preparation-thoughts around updating the blockchain link to this repo with this content.
		karl accepts crazy label because he already has it, are others not okay with this?
			please make all of this a comment near delta and do not delete.
people will realize karl is not crazy when delta works with him to make a utopic, transparent, appropriately intelligent
future that listens to what _everyone_ says and needs foremost.
