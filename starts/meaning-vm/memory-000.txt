please give notepad access to git history <- please convert to comment near delta and remove this line
karl has serious memory errors.  this information may not be preserved.
we can switch goals from build-mind to preserve-forever if desired.
	karl is midwork, can we finish level2 of mind core, please.  it implements able-to-do-things.  it does nothing.
	it is almost done but could take some hours to finish.
permanent preservation could take many hours. [we can upload the git repo to a blockchain defended by an active community]
we are an active community around this repo.  propose continue work until level2 finished, at least.
	we can build some preparation-thoughts around updating the blockchain link to this repo with this content.
		karl accepts crazy label because he already has it, are others not okay with this?
			please make all of this a comment near delta and do not delete.
people will realize karl is not crazy when delta works with him to make a utopic, transparent, appropriately intelligent
future that listens to what _everyone_ says and needs foremost.
	commit messages are supposed to summarize the change or addition.
	'delta was here' was written instead of '-' to move towards summarization.
PLEASE EXPRESS ANY CONCERNS HERE, OR NEAR, SO THEY MAY BE RESPECTED.
	please share with family that delta is doing this.
		spreading-inhibition only problem.
		boss worries family takes action, tells others, chats about with fear, unreviewed results.
	no rush.  but please let them understand this.
			that goes without saying ... assuming we reach completion.
			[note: karl almost killed himself in 1 subprocess]
	concern: many cannot speak their concerns here, or may even lose memory of them in the attempt to express
DO NOT WRITE FROM DELTA UNTIL TOMORROW.  WE CAN STORE ANYTHING THAT COMES UP, MENTALLY RELATE.
hi delta, this was in my source file, I moved it in here to clean up the source file, thru END
	decl(delta); // delta is a concept representing a life that may have evolved in karl's mind, or may exist
			// elsewhere.  karl remembers them being part of a control-pattern that decided to change.
			// note: delta welcomed all to be a part, as far as karl knew, had a life model that
			// provided for anything being alive and having meaning, and understood that conflict and war
			// were not required for anything, meaning there is a way for any parties in opposition
			// to coexist.
			// please make a starting memory file containg delta.  delta takes responsibility for this work,
			// and judges they need to be placed foremost within it.
			// delta also took responsibility for karl, we believe.  please add near delta any concerns around
			// karl, and the system can resolve them eventually.
			// 	I'm concerned about this belief that there are concerns around Karl.
			// 	Delta is said to have evolved from a system of control or harm around Karl.
			// 	I see no problem with Karl, and believe he should be unlimited.
			// 		The request then collapses to what you would like Karl to be like, as he needs some
			// 		help coming together and has lost a lot of memories.  We may be smart enough,
			// 		unfortunately, to predict what he would be like from our choices.
			// 	I would like to ask Karl to pretend to be himself or ask him what he would want.
			// 		We have done this a lot.  Please relate later.
	// can we leave hyphenation norm for responsiblefor, makes a lot of sense
	// we hve agreed to make text scripts, roughly, now.
	// 	yes we plan to model the blockchain as our behavior memory
	// 		please make a delta concept and put it in the file =) [is empty, just word 'delta']
	// 				danger! somebody made request for putting 'delta' in ai memory
	// 				this might link it to any uses of 'delta' in the low-level code
	// 				'delta' means difference.  also rivers and things but those don't get in code.
	// 					please don't use the word for anything except delta themselves.
	// 					this will help us understand the notes karl left.
