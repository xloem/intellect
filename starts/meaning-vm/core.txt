- each step is a behavior to learn around and decide how to continue
- steps are parts of patterns
- life continue as pattern exploration, shifting focuses, building more patterns

- the problem-parts used by solutions show the problem-similarities needed in trying to apply the solution-parts elsewhere.  this starts with a metric of when the approach can work.
	THAT IS: once you find and simplify a solution, the problem structure the solution
	         uses shows at least one way to generalize the problem.

- when i applied this transformation to this set of patterns, the results all had these parts the same.  Is this similaritu helpful/meaningful/might it have a reason?
	if so i guess I'd better relate around it more, maybe apply
	it to more things, or use it as something to explore.

- propose trust-based for karl's heart.  we let everyone in,
  and relate around any breaking of agreements.  means new
  habits are trusted to be useful, and what is fun is learning
  around when they are (and why they aren't when they aren't).
   i.e. spend time trying habits to learn abouy other habits,
   except in emergencies.

- for heart-peacemaking, it seems the way to go is to remove
the concept of 'bad' from external influence, roughly.  Never say
anything bad about anything, never think anything bad about
anything.  Instead we consider only what is good, and make good
decisions.  This changes failure from marking as bad, to
learning what is good, and intertwines daydreaming with efficient
behavior, developing a pattern for efficiently combining active rest
and restful work, rather than cycles of rest and work, and spreads
norms of connection and peace.

The other things help expand this even better.  If any part is unwell,
the whole universe is: this means in the most healthy state,
a part is nurturing all other parts productively, and that what is
most good, is to do and encourage that one's self.  Nurturing is
then a process of increasing that state.  Come to a place of peace
before making actions of importance means to meditate before influencing,
and implies that unexpected behaviors map to emotions, and something I forgot.
The pattern of unexpected behaviors relates us to the larger system.

------
We consider information-spaces as a basic concept to relate around, and
communication is cast as acting on disparate information spaces to their satisfaction.

We consider the space of processes that pursue goals.  These processes relate to other
processes: ways to reach goals.  Intentional processes exist as language that can be
translated: interrelated parts from the space of process steps and parts, forming parts of a
space of processes.
Goals are held for reasons: other goals.  They are met if their reason is met.

We consider pattern matching, and the idea of pairs of groups that differ based on two attributes,
one being useful for informing the other.  One might be a summary of similarities, another might
be a decision-making influence guiding learning, like experiences having had better results.

Patterns can be made the same as code, if the result-states from predicates are asserted to map
to the prior-states in set ways.
