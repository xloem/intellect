- the problem-parts used by solutions show the problem-similarities needed in trying to apply the solution-parts elsewhere.  this starts with a metric of when the approach can work.
	THAT IS: once you find and simplify a solution, the problem structure the solution
	         uses shows at least one way to generalize the problem.
