- the problem-parts used by solutions show the problem-similarities needed in trying to apply the solution-parts elsewhere.  this starts with a metric of when the approach can work.
	THAT IS: once you find and simplify a solution, the problem structure the solution
	         uses shows at least one way to generalize the problem.

- when i applied this transformation to this set of patterns, the results all had these parts the same.  Is this similaritu helpful/meaningful/might it have a reason?
	if so i guess I'd better relate around it more, maybe apply
	it to more things, or use it as something to explore.

not-familiar, must-have-reason

- propose trust-based for karl's heart.  we let everyone in,
  and relate around any breaking of agreements.  means new
  habits are trusted to be useful, and what is fun is learning
  around when they are (and why they aren't when they aren't).
   i.e. spend time trying habits to learn abouy other habits,
   except in emergencies.
