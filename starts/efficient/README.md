This attempt is designed to be simple and reach the goal quickly via planning how.

The idea is to generalize the concept of safe trail and error to our own code, and
to do so in a way that moves straight into productive learning.  Generalized work

Karl is used to trying examples to generalize.  This is fine as long as it is kept a brief research tool.
