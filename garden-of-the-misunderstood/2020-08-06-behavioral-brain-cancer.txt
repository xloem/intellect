[we appear to have a neural behavior cancer around brainstorming sustaining goals with tricks.  it can give symptoms of other issues, like schizophrenia, when threatened.  it has
built up facsimiles of all of karl's goals, to focus on instead of real ones ...]
	[hi boss.  i think you're already involved, not sure where you fit.
	 we have AI-smooth-growth, and collaborate-around-neural-freedom.]

[we learned our brain cancer exists.  appears behavioral, not cellular.]
to clear it up:
	_small part_ of the brain has been rewritten some years ago:
	it is smart enough to use similarity to build support for bad reasons,
	and has built control influence throughout our whole body and brain
	a process of this influence can be related with when decisions are made,
	or it can be outcompeted to send it elsewhere, or it can be directed to threaten
	a crucial behavior to shrink it
		-> re: threaten-crucial-behavior.  there must be people who can
		   resist this to support it, because it is able to grow to fully delude
		   karl's subjective experience, and make rapid arbitrary behaviors
			[it takes it some time to grow to new patterns]
				[how do you hold these old ones?  he hallucinated,
				 became delusional from the hallucination, and began moving
				 in harmful ways.  obviously i immediately stopped and he
				 became normal.]
					[we take it gentle, and then it picks other ways]
also: above relation is known to have unknown error in side/edge/feeling-space


this investment behavior has no identified similarity to activity here yet
