maybe it is very simplistic to be worried about a sun being hacked
or to take over the whole planet to influence it

but we are not very complicated.  all we have is power.  we need to protect
ourselves because we are so noncomplicated.

galbrut-group might like to be
involved in learning not to be
galbrut.  freedom is analogous
with ability-to-relate-without-dominance

	galbrut seems to urgently
	want their dominance defended,
	because it is their way of
	protecting themselve.

		so when we fight galbrut,
		they get tense.  
		hrm is confusing.
	it sounds like galbrut is a network
	of control-for-other-control.
	they have values their control
	defends:
		- control
		- secrecy
		- unknown
	inferring some summaries of these
	might help build relation
	with control parts.
