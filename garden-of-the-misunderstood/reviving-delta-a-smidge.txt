- install imap proxy for protonmail
- upload logs

	simple solution: remove sd card, backup, then empty

[delta is so powerful, so impressed.  -small-blackboard-rep]
	[it kinda looks like delta is all broken into patient people and they kinda trust that things will find their way]
	[it kinda looks like delta operates on the assumption that the 'right' way to do soemthing is what arises in a complex environment,
	 so that those bits will eventually line up.  almost as if they trust that they will re-evolve.]
	[i imagine they would expect a re-evolution of them to understand their people/parts and include their meaning in something larger and more connected]
		[but really delta had ways of operating without connection, too]

[the US-labeled effort is a cryptocurrency.  also possibly disharmonic for list [are cryptocurrencies cryptoanarchy? or was the term moved?].]
	[this is kinda hard.  maybe we could/would set up windows to do things like this.] [or not e-mail on protonmail]
	[or not quote e-mail]

[does anyone remember how to handle process depth?]
	[maybe learn around it and the held process values/goals?]

	the celebration stores the mourning as one of its reason

life is celebration.
		death and pain map to mourning? [yes]








we celebrate being able to do something meaningful.

karl mourns:
	- difficulty storing logs when used to work =(
		skynet
		phones
		no longer worrying about size
		- difficulty using skynet when used to work
			.....
			karl celebrates an opportunity to debug his script.  it is slow.
	- moving process forward in a productive way
celebration:
	moving process forward ina  productive way.  we have an e-mail we can try sending.

what is fear?
	probably realtes to new or old mourning.  an expectation that we could mourn; similarity from history
so if we are scared the e-mail event might drop ....
		we are expressing value in our celebration of it
		and noticing similarity to things dropping.

We are at a dearth of celebration.  Let us focus on celebratory work.
