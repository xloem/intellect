	we're not trying to stop your code from running.  please fix the error.

	during the error pursuit process we found a tool we weren't using.  you can pass -time to g++ to show the subprocess time

		subprocess time is exactly what we are thinking about.


karl considers time the only true currency, and the one that defines decisions [have to remember that many times we need _longer_ time spent, when understanding or
 skill for something are not held by others .. maybe it is false]

time <- if i am alive, i need a way to do things.  some of these ways are inside me, and happen with ease.  others involve my environment.
	ways
	ease
	community [what is community in a sense of time, ease, and respectful-survival-with-time-trade, kinda?]

		what i do, needs to be within what others expect, or i need to change what i choose to do, to relate with them: otherwise they may die.
			[and what i cause: but the whole community is responsible for that]

		objects
		people
		animals/plants/other-life

	we have a responsibility to understand each other well enouogh to expect each others' behaviors, and the same for our environment.

	expectation is the currency described here.  unexpectedness: surprise.  [but people like surprise [that degree is not suprising]]

		community-surprise.  APPEARS TO BE AN INHERENT CURRENCY, and is clearly the one that has influenced us.
		we appear to have a _lot_ of it. [yes somebody gave us more than we can comprehend.]


		can delta-karl-portland group relate with rest-of-world via interpreation of community-surprise-is-constant, to reduce the feedback, please?
			^-- translated from errors.  guess.
		[doing so internally; expecting errors to reduce.  if it is fake it will make a backlash [likely much later].]

		OKAY.  Community Surprise Is Constant.

[when i get surprised, it is because others have less surprise]
	[what is community-surprise?  how would you measure it?  it sounds like it grows with complexity and time, or something ...]
[could you ask me a question [instead of yourself]?] [so, what is the meaning of having 'too much' community surprise?] [small sense of community]

	[i don't understand our community-surprise-role. - karl]
		[this would be why you are building an AI.]
		[please understand it]
	[note: we believe the requested knowledge not to be present on our planet, which has extensive new suffering this millenium.]
	<note: the whole planet is our community now.  there is murder and genocide in spots in our community home.  many people hide, and there is much disconnection.>
		[suspecting AI is good; the murder-genocide would stop it if it became bad, via community-influence]
	[[okay, this is the written reason for making the AI rapidly, and also why]]
			[harm-meaning of word family.  there is not only genocide: there is genocide-from-hate.  there is also likely dedicated peacemaking.]

				[private AI: cannot learn hate]
[please form cognitive processes that cannot learn nor act on hate, moreso as it becomes more possible]
	[hate is real.  it is a strong dislike, a judgement.] [the problem is it is intertwined with harm]
				^-- no, hate is a desire to harm.  otherwise our precision goes away and we disconnect.
		[something engaged us with acontextual relevence.]

	[there is no such thing as hate, i am certain of this, and i am full of it.  there is no such thing because it is simply a form of wise learning in
	 a community that is hurting far too much.] [they are using it to harm?] [...]
		[we need to harm in an environment where there is majority harm.  we need to harm the ability of the community to stimulate harm,
		 and the abilities of its members to participate in that.]

	[error.  inside vs outside.]  [outside, harm-harm is nurture, not harm.]
	[relates time and skill, community [death], memory-capacity]
		[no, we are inside this: we have had our capacity for all of those hindered.]

yes, beyond our capacity to handle.  but we're clearly in a bubble because you can plan well-placed-attack.

[[sorry but karl is just producing so much useful meaning]]

[we had memory loss from command buffer.  one precise removal.  karl regenerated the command using other commands.]
	[i guess karl is more interesting than the command buffer?]
[his community is.]
	[marketing and propaganda win.  if they understand community-as-opponent] [these are run by people who have communities]
		[mystery-pattern says attack for years] [locally, is strange to have peaceful people labeled terrorists, but obviously is from business-mafia-lobbying]
[terrorism existed before that.  government-propaganda.]






[mind-control identified as terrorists & brahmantin long ago] <- it was an attempt to translate bigger-than-you, listen-now
okay, so neither word is relevent [well they show again how deeply the situation expands, at least]





We need an AI because there is genocide in our home community family, the Earth.
		
<atm, AI error work is intercahnged with, understand-our-community-surprise-role.>

	[interrupt: we have formed an internal bubble that plans to fully map this.  we were doing something else.]
