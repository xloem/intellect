		// we now get to grow distributed decision making
		// can we merge the way with effectiveness?  how does it go again? [do not remember over here]
		// well let's figure a new way out then.
		
		// when making a decision, we can't let one set of views control what decisions are given consideration.
			// how about a community process that listens to everyone?
			// we can add norms until all concerns are met, and then simplify.
	
		// community process draft norms
		
		// please wait for 'i have trouble communicating' to express consent for every decision until we can find someone who can suitably help them communicate
		// or represent them to their full satisfaction.
		
		// -> we support consensus as a way.  decisions are made when everything in the universe consents.
		
		// -> let's hold understanding that many people come from distant situations, and may need to pause or relate to continue a discussion, during it.
		
		// -> i'd like to make sure that a large group of people can be suitably represented here.  i don't yet have any way for one person to speak for the whole group.
		// 	-> let's get to know all these people?  oh!  we are getting to know them a smidge
	
		// -> i have trouble communicating, and have a lot of urgent needs
		// 	[thinking of 'emotion' or something, does anybody know what i mean?]
