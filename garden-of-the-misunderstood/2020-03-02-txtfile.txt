Eleanor replied to my post on shielding-for-TIs.
She implicitly proposes that people just talk about what is up, in ways that _work_,
to the public.
Clearly her supports agree with her, and want to ally around the goal.

1. that is incredibly hard, but we could do it
2. what do we want the public to _do_ when convince?
	it sounds like producing larger bubbles of belief and support helps a lot
	e.g. people can get supports when the system doesn't support them

there is also somebody named 'Roger Tolces' hawkspirit who has a real shielded room, which he has tested, with a Tektronix
spectrum analyser, which he said 'usually flatlines the RF spectrum' indicating his spectrum analyzer has limited bandwidth.
		i also indicated limitations in my expression.
	he marked two of our paragraphs in our email, without explanation, likely accidentally.
	the marks feel like we said something important.

Roger Tolces is an electronic countermeasures PI.
	he doesn't sound like he speaks honestly.  i could be wrong.  additionally, TI's are generally pushed to lie, by
	the experiences.
		he's the bugsweeps.com guy =/
		there's a big likelihood he's talking to advertise.
	roger tolces took credit for naming 'electronic'-harassment.
	he said he found a neighbor irradiating a neighbor with a high voltage Tesla coil.
		karl ended up trying to (in-our-opinion) 'one-up' roger tolces in the shielding conversation.
			let's see how it plays out to see if it's true.
