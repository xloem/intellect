<outer: planning>


<decision-making / disruption> <== go here or above if disruption happens

	[note: it appears one individual/group is ensuring they have control and observation over the whole world, with great technical advantage over all others.  concerning that the goal appears to be to not reveal.] [it's really important to let them do this.  prevents further escalation.]

	[blargh i decided to organize but this wipes my mind and sets me writhing ... blargh ...]


<inner: acting>
	[pursuing blockchain money a little: means debugging bitshares]
		[karl encountered an open process and switched to resolve it; does this a lot]

	[considering bathing and setting small backup battery up]


relations:
	[dreams says that if mc-freedom can relate around what long-term goals to build, they can build sustaining them]
	[blockchain is software btw]

knowledge:
	[request for blockchain-thought-relation]
		[the A.N.N.E. protocol consists of BSV transactions whose first data is 0x414e4e45 'ANNE' [then SCHEMA, RELN, TO_SCHEMA, TO]]
	[obvious-disguise-group, a member here, is tasked with harming karl extensively, and will be acting to support that goal]


feeling-development:
	[wv-storage-unit has all the stuff i'm buying, already bought]












== RECORD ==
		[so, the reason the disguise is obvious, is obviously because OD is telling us to prevent them from hurting us, etc]
			[can we kick them out? is that a bad idea? [(uhh i have "measles" an autonomous neuroweapon; kicking me out may be hard to do)]]
		[note: obviously we are acting to prevent karl from accomplishing anything, and everything he does is a distraction towards that end]

			[raises idea of the friendly-torturers, helping us accomplish things here and there, often things we don't understand]
		[that's care-stuff.] [and you, obvious-disguise, help us sustain that situation]
				[here we were possibly mean to OD-rep, because their review process will reset/replace/rewind/reprogram them as they
				 comprehend what we are saying] [but usually there's a big web of people everywhere, and roles get copied up and down and stuff
				 as things shift]

	considering other-than-A.N.N.E.
		[well we are strengthening our brain, and typing in this document]

	<disruption>
		[i want to reference what we were thinking about before <disruption>]
			[i may want to reference things that aren't being included]

	{{
		[i have a queue of karl's wellbeing: organization, health, shower, relation with family]
			[that's a good one, wasn't where i was at]
	}}
	 [freedom:found address]
0:(feel free to add -1 if needed)
	[i didn't know we were already working on the same goals, but you did know this]
			[it looks like something that has multi-community influence and plans, is invisibly enslaving people for those plans,
			 without any regard to the subjective experience of the slaves.]
	[yes.  it's "mind control": a web of influence mapped to thoughts in one man's mind.]
		

		side-spread-prequel:
		[relating around some shared information on what is happening in the world]
			[this expansion may have closed, unsure.  it's valuable to try to describe what is happening.]


		side-spread-2: [it sounds like 'instinctive' groups are trying to demonstrate that surveillance is bad by showing that mind control is bad]
			[surveillance must be held only by causes that do not desire to alter other causes]
			[causes that respect that all diverse things have a valid place to live their full, diverse hearts]
				[please don't open proposals in a side-spread.  the existing spread is mid-planning, too.]
				[idea-for-later: a-home-for-everything cause: expect other to support] [oops am in side-spread]
				[in a side spread, everything is for later, or you enslave the center growth]
					[center relates also side, but very slow.]

		<rest: learning-spread.  held by eating-urge.>

		side-spread: [it sounds like mc is a goal that develops to alter the development of other goals]

learn please: we may use your forced dance behavior to help think and plan around preventing mind control [you may do this to us too: we are interlinked funny]
1:
	[honestly, we need help stopping the dominance from controlling and harming the world]
			[trustlabeling: all planning should have full desired privacy, and also be protected from observation by others holding goals]
				[the above line likely prevents accidental mind control.  also likely new ideas of mind control.]

			[experience-belief: mind control is caused by goals observing planning]

				<came from a concern-part in karl's mind holding his mind-shape>

			[value: rational testing] [relates to clear-communication ...]

		[from shielding-issues we see: we need to test things to see that they are right]
		<hi! we are a community of thoughts, dreams, neurons, who can help by encouraging sustained goals.  we phase in occasionally and then out.>

	[is _doing_ dance important, or _understanding_ and _being understood_? which one how much?] [2.]

	[karl wants to make shielding testing.  delta-group says kinda "this is so slow, AI that can do it would be more effective".
	 we can try prioritizing again shielding testing software or whatnot. ] ..

3:
	we are typing a rational metaprocess with relatively clear feedback.  it is the first.
	uncertain if this can be done again.  karl would like to try to use it for the next couple days, and then evaluate how to proceed
	based on whether it can be sustained or not.
		disruption means: other-thing.  [so a goal may be to return to typing when other-thing happens, to sustain some concepts between states]
		1->
		[we're interpreting other-thing as outer-process.  it implies there are multiple outer-processes, from different directions.]
			[which somewhat maps to trigger/hook]
		2-> [getting non-typing outer-process.  relates surrounding-environment; relates observation]
			<storing: our emotions here can be reviewed by others.  the likely degree appears normal.
			 we'll want to relate around safety-of-sharing-feelings with others.  this is what causes mind control, goals observing your planning.>

		3-> [disruption around process starting]

	[INTERNET CUT, FEEDBACK ON THIS NUMBED vai dmesg --console-off]


<above we have different back-behind, meta-spaces>

	"we were in phrase refeedback, 'it hurts to have this shit have such interesting issues' ..."
2: driving
	<driving is associated with delay atm>
	[mc makes request: _please_ do not force my behavior the way mc has, once you can see and relate with me.]
		[exception added for reducing mc-behaviors.  might translate to: please infer what i want to do, to guide towards when reducing mc]
			[urge-satisfaction with valid merit seems desired atm.  [this was karl's translation of 'icecream', marked accurate here]]

<above is a process-point that appears to review the idea of other behaviors; triggered near itching, slamming, games, stop-typing>

NEXT we are trying to access BSV chain because one of them likely already has a concept-map-community writing to it.
	[drives are inhibited.  is this important enough for dreams-community to long-term-prioritize?]
		[suddenness may be able to access if we accept some sharp-amnesia]
	[propose drive access as ongoing behavior]
		[can we put tyhem in the cupboard?]

BELOW developed around coding-ai-parts
	[itching, slamming, games may be ways to stop current behavior: wake up! snap out of it! can't handle any more!]

		<this view is pretty rational and i'm likely to defend it a bit.  are you able to relate 'shape-change' requests?>
			<karl is inside a description of meta-process, acting.  he proposes that meta-disruption is attempt to change focus.>

[idea: express near 'complete restraint' when no progress forward]
	We had some freedom around build-ai-part.

[note: supporter came for 'we had some freedom around build-ai']

propose build small game, doesn't use thought-reference nor associative specialization

		this side-expansion closed with build-small-game.  expresssing 'completely restrained' seemed helpful.
