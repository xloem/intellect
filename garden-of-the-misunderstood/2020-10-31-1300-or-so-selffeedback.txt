the request is to learn around strong desire to have been prepared
for the weekly videocall, by remembering it was happening while
handling the death ninja growth and the life role in the days
prior.

		....
		



		death ninjas need reason for growth
		so decisions can be made around whether
		to risk death or not in different circumstances.







[imagine yelling for first bit]
	karl was, um, not prepared for his family weekly videocall
	if he had remembered it was happening over the past couple days,
	he could have prepared more capacity for it.

	we are upset he couldn't move during the call,
	and we expect that his brother's family didn't
	show off their halloween costumes, to protect
	them from seeing him during this.

	they were unavailable.
