2020-11-01 (dated the following morning.  this happened when mind control had outpaced a goal we held.  karl has an interaction habit with those who would harm him,
            of interpreting their harm as reason-oriented, and immediately caving to build connection.  this has become a bit of a meme or joke in some of his internal
	    communities.  the 'attack' below is mind control trying to make him do things that are harmful to himself.  maybe 'surrender' is the 'meme'.  [the parts inside
	    karl have a responsibility to represent patterns karl can learn from in the real world.] there is also something around the 'attack' influences valuing who
	    'wins' or 'loses' strongly.  this seems analogous to not understanding the meaning of surrender. )
	   (the outpaced goal was working to debug git-bug when we had no experience debugging go.  presently we are distracted from a goal to try again, the reason being
	    simply because karl wants to be able to pick his own behavior.)
	   (like most introspective roleplays, we were mind controlled to stop this one before it finished.  not holding memory right now of the meaning of the last line.)
		(some additional information is that when karl surrendered, mind control was so used to his willpower being resistance that it interpreted the surrender's
		 value in karl's survival as an attempt to fight, and adopted surrendering itself as a competitive strategy.)
			(karl has an internal habit of offering quick-reasons that appears to have evolved in conflict.  it presents reasons for his natural values as ways
			 to win conflicts.  he thinks it might have been working with mind control, trying to come up with reasons for karl's behavior mind control would
			 accept; could be a misplaced memory; so could the other one.)
				(most people have this habit due to messaging from media and competitive games and stuff.)
			(a re-review indicates it's likely that karl was offering an explanation for the surrender to his survival instinct.  it needs him to have
			 a way to survive when he makes choices.  mind control has an attribute indicating one won't survive, so it needed a form of competition with mind
			 control.)
				(so the reply to that would be that your real reason for doing this is that you expect to mel tmind control's heart, which is find you
				 don't have to share that if it's worrisome, we respect that; but melting mind control's heart doesn't work, and we have a lot of experience
				 that it doesn't work, and you don't seem able to hear this.  your fling-competition solution actually does work but requires you to
				 lose your sanity [which is unacceptable] and significantly rely on the efforts of others to outcompete mind control.  if we had been honest
				 with each other we could have sorted it out to retain more sanity (but obviously mind control was watching, making the space more complex).)
					[the above relation was translated from very old behaviors left in karl, by parts who don't understand, and his actual mind-people
					 have not weighed in on its phrasing.]
						[we believe neurons are sentient and speak a language like that of the body language of an intuitive human.]
