2020-11-01 (dated the following morning.  this happened when mind control had outpaced a goal we held.  karl has an interaction habit with those who would harm him,
            of interpreting their harm as reason-oriented, and immediately caving to build connection.  this has become a bit of a meme or joke in some of his internal
	    communities.  the 'attack' below is mind control trying to make him do things that are harmful to himself.  maybe 'surrender' is the 'meme'.  [the parts inside
	    karl have a responsibility to represent patterns karl can learn from in the real world.] there is also something around the 'attack' influences valuing who
	    'wins' or 'loses' strongly.  this seems analogous to not understanding the meaning of surrender. )
	   (the outpaced goal was working to debug git-bug when we had no experience debugging go.  presently we are distracted from a goal to try again, the reason being
	    simply because karl wants to be able to pick his own behavior.)
	   (like most introspective roleplays, we were mind controlled to stop this one before it finished.  not holding memory right now of the meaning of the last line.)
