We did not tell polaris these things:

	-> how controllers hold understanding of the psychological breaking of
           others and work with that to control them, and how this needs to be taught to
           the public in schools so that people can rescue victims instead of falling for
           their lies

	-> that saying words like 'trafficking' and 'freedom' makes it
           impossible for brainwashed people to contact you.
	   





I sent to them about the word 'freedom'.

I think I was brainwashed to be a slave.  I think brainwashing is a very precise and well understooid thing that is commonly used.
I think I was brainwashed to see the word 'brainwash' as silly.


			we want to sustain focus on situation.




I am beginning to decide not to involve my mom, because I have been trained not to scare people by sharing things.
			We are worried she wouldn't remember.
			This brings desire to involve our father.  Let's conference call them?
			Let's ask if they can help our parents, too.

note: forcing someone to work to pay off a debt can be considered trafficking
