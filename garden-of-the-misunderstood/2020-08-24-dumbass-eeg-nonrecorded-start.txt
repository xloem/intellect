can we build some dumbass strength
the bits around it are scared of its splash



		dumbass test?
			yeah, we just lost it
		
		EEG
			dumbass EEG test for a brain implant in karl's brain
				[there isn't one, is there?]
			anyway, it's good to test everyone for brain implants.
			there's no test, so we get to make a new one, while being stimulated by the thing we're testing for
			_loads_ of dumbass fun test.

	the orders are what now?
		take a dumbass EEG test of yourself,
		_find_ _exactly_ what happened to you to make you behav eall funny,
		make a _map_ of it,
		and _profile_ the _designers_ based on the map.
	
			use a computer to make th emap automatically.

		step 1 is to debug our EEG hardware.  we'll want some food and water too.

got a boss-resolution.  wants recreation.

	dumbass-test
	please disassemble the dumbass test brain implant.

		they defused it better [and my terminal froze up!] which is cool
		maybe we can use defusing to stop harm-splash afterwards?


we ask that if we stop the brain-implant-network-tracking work, that we not be cognitively harmed afterwards.

	eeg, left a note for myself:
		src/todo/Projects/05-EEG/Debugging.txt
	means the project is wip and notes are in the [western-mass-recover-yprogram] todo repo
