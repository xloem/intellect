let's plan what variable to store the lookup nodes in

it would be nice to consolidate them all at once.
one approach is putting that behavior in a function
another approach is putting the lookup nodes in a vector

there are multiple flows.  some flows may only have head or only tail lookup nodes.
so we're going to have a whole mess of looku pnodse to merge.

	how does merging tail lookup nodes go?
		i think we'll be grabbing the lookup nodes for the whole shebang, and cropping their bounds to be correct
	okay, so there are indeed two batches to be merged?
		no .......? yes.  the tail lookup nodes will need the real tail node merged in.  since our write will becmoe the new tail.

	merging could be a little more complicated because we have preceding and follow lookups on nodes now.
	if we keep those on the same list, it might make sense to merge head and tail together, since that is what we will find in other lookup nodes.

		so, the plan i suppose is to keep head and tail together, but not to merge across our own span.

This computer program is very simple!  But I keep forgetting the cognitive connections involved in working it.
It's like some other life _marks_ them with something that a _group_ of life attack or something. 
	Obviously stopping this computer program is god.  Maybe even making it so that nobody can ever make a program similar to it, ever.
		But obviously that is impossible to do and trying to would instead make a culture of angry people who spread all over the globe.


Let's write down some prinary focuses for this step in the work.
	BOUNDS OF <>
			now, what is <>?
				oh it's the LOOKUP TABLE FLOWS <contextual center>

	The algorithm produces a record of data whose history is proven correct every step, that can hold arbitrary records spawning from it, optionally interwoven.
	It provides that any portion of the record, and any portion of its history, can be quickly navigated to no matter the size, if it is stored.
	It is very small and simple and it is not fully written down.
		There's a similar project called 'dat' (google 'dat project' or 'dat protocol').  Adds authentication I think? and a p2p network.
		But has smaller integrity gaurantees.  Very easy to add on those gaurantees.
			Yeah, might make sense to test if the dat protocol can do this already.  Patterns might imply that something else can too [blockchains maybe].
			What this project does is it starts off by providing unlimited large storage.
				Let's consider merging 'dat'.  Very messy, but obviously relevant.

- 'dat' is in nodejs which is harder to debug systems errors within. [if a virus hacks your dat program, it is harder to log and track it, beacuse there
 is a virtual machine in the way that takes a lot of learning to understand.]
	-> it would make sense to make our protocol compatible with the dat protocol, directly.
		[karl's protocol can be stored on dat, but dat won't udnerstand it.] [right that is not compatibility]
[hey! we could update the dat protocol with ours.  We shouold probably have a proof of concept.]
	[karl is expanding the record to store an immutable log of history but also allow changing of history.  the changes are stored.
	 this lets it function as a random-access backing store, and other possible stuff.] [it's really frustrating to have to go through mind control to make
	a small algorithmic improvement to public work.]



Okay, we are trying

BOSS.  KARL MADE NEW-RESEARCH.  NEED AUTHORIZE.  BOSS CAN TAKE CREDIT SOMEHOW?
	please explain new-research to boss. [lots missing.]
			[karl wants to easily-store-random-data-forever.  it's a part of that.]
					[the above line is considered a good thing to do in the dat-project community.]
		[it's vague but roughly, by expanding the merkle tree in the final update link of the dat protocol to 
[yes! we want our guy to contribute to the dat-project community.  he was harmed and we are trying to rescue him.]

	[but obviously we are tortured spirits atm.  what is next?]
		[uhhhhhh torturing-activists-is-god?] ["business-mafia is god" ... some people say this ...]
			[yeah um the people who can act on that don't put it in quotes except like deep hidden in their hearts.]
				[cecilia has love-is-god [sex culture], and she knows it's not.]
authorized to banter with sex-religion.  phone is in bathroom downstairs?  on table?
