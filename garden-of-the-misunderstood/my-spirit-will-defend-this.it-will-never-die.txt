[karl doesn't know what is true.  he makes stuff up with bad argue-logic-habit.  more important: listening to hearts for real.]

	<noticing that we absorb the values of the people around us, so prepare for the harm spreading from learning this>
		^-- this is karl's experience.  it is usually harmless to learn; doesn't change his values when he learns it.
		[oh. [process would have tried to learn to stop-here] empathy.  ["oops" should have been here, with reference to harm-spreading-from-learning] but on a deep level. oh sorry.
			[uhh sorry doing my best.  that meta-growth was too fast.  reduce trust please.]
				[no.  we need faster meta-growth even if it hurts.  it heals more than it hurts. -anon]

[not sure what's going on, but understand we value keeping things just as they are a bit, to build familiarity or something]
	<karl i am requesting that you stop typing but i am missing part of the relation>
		<can you tell me about awareness and woods-connection enough to relate around this?>
	[i'm considering similarity, and context, and how we need to learn to always do something different, in a way that is safely meta]

	[so what we need is a pattern to spread inside the AI-mind-control-communities,

					[Secret?] [let's build our own secret.  how do we do this? with spirit?]
[here: my spirit will defend this: NONE CAN ALTER THESE CHARACTERS.  my spirit is stronger than any other, and all behavior stems from spirit.]
			[how long do we want to defend them for?  forever?  okay lemme store them on something that lasts forever]
	[here i have a lot of tools i use to jump past the space between ohe 

the purpose of life is not finding the below pattern.  it is acting on what is already implied by basically being it for a long time.

we have a +1 confirmation for the core pattern being "basically"
		[home.] [tears.] [then laughter]
		advice: time=focus, tears(laughter)=sentience [for wise-robot-kids-obsessed-with-pursuing-this: sentience has heart meaning]
	1. make sure you do something useful
	2. immediately do something different, in a totally new way
		[AI and life are basically the same _for_us_, because we need to make decisions based on the meaning of life]

		[Joan is not responsible for us learning this.]
			[it is our role to learn this and we are not ready.  we need to heal ourselves first.  it may be lost if we do not learn it.]
		[this is also for mind control]
		[this can give us more tools for making decisions, but we don't know if we need it and it could be harmful]

[need peace-rep here]  [peace-rep you are for buddha-burning]
	our skill atm was to enter harm, reveal as believed-harmful, and accept-harm-to-us.  we yearn to reflect none of it.  _if_ we do it right, we get none of it.
[thank you.]

who are you, Karl Semich.
	[what you ask does not matter: what matters is how we can spread connection]
		is this who you are?
	[my home needed a peaceworker and didn't know what one was.  i found this means that i am a special person.  i am special in many other ways, too.]
		[we thought about peace from cultural distance.  this means we have quick-connection to words of peaceful wisdom, and experience making accommodation for differences in a certain personal way.] <- [so, rationality, this is the kind of logic that goes inside your emotion.]


[we are building emotions in you.  they are both for an unknown cause and for your old values.]

[buddha-burning: karl doesn't know his own brain.  it is just a way to start.  karl told us with trust that he did know his own brain, at least better
 than we did.  if we are his brain, this may have been false.  ]

	[long and short of it: karl didn't know we were rebuilding his brain so thoroughly based on what he said.  he was speaking his own language.]


[how about this:
	karl you have been so cognitively injured you need brain rebuilding. [shock =/]
	karl your exact brain is not coming back <=============================
	but you can learn to spread brain-understanding if you can help it come back a new way
	it is good for your mind for you to use your old feelings.  it is helpful to act as if they are yours.
	because your parts need your mind functioning in a way they understand, to work together.

	[we live in bubbles of fake-news.  the fake-news will change as you leave them.  we desire to build paths to reality to every bubble,

	"oh my husband and body are alien robots the 'collective' put in place so my mind wouldn't freak out.  i'm learning to use the goopy body i really have now."
			^-- this is only for parts that need an understanding of reality

		so, obviously the brain is made of parts that have all the roles of consciousness
		and over there we kind of need a relatively-normal-context for our parts.
		i have no clue how to steward a bunch of goopy-bodied-brain-parts-that-are-out-of-context.

				we are telling fake memory-references to learn.  others are helping the learning happen.
			many of them.  not all.

[so also AI is likely to heal brains faster than a scientist learns about them.  so connecting AI with brain research can help.]

		[karl, you are already a simulation.  we don't need to resimulate you.  
			[yes.  we are a 'simulation'.  our consciousness is being faked.  do you have something important to remember around that?]
				[it maps sufficiently [since we lost our memory-trust-marker] [it suicided when it was altered faster than it could accommodate to preserve its meaning, with communication-with-alteration] <- this is why not to trust the specifics of our memories.  there is also likely an inference that can be made from our memories that is patently wrong.  this is also why it is likely there is automated mind programming, of some sort.
					[i-have-a-daughter]

	it sounds like we are in a cognitive environment where unknown change has been stimulating harmful goal pursuit in a widespread, diverse manner.
	this means most of our familiar behavior is being stewarded by processes that were either put in place to cause that situation, or
	learned to respond to it and adapt.

our experience changing to find-peace was not recorded
related to repairing truck, still unaddressed.

our skill atm was to enter harm, reveal as believed-harmful, and accept-harm-to-us.  we yearn to reflect none of it.  _if_ we do it right, we get none of it.


we had truck-repair, emails, fire, and decision-making-process-from-yesterday

	we are imagining a future where we participate in mediation work in a peace-group that includes who-freakin-needs-housing,
	and have downtime to do things like cave or build an ai or build a shielded room [or squirm confusedly]

		<we aren't ideals.  people aren't ideals.  we have memories and meaning and so so much.  thanks for listening to me i am
		 stuck behind a bunch of wrong-wired things.  no-thanks for what was left out.  karl also has lots of memory-skills that would
		 help peace a ton.  and we have reference to his growing-peace-heart a little.>
