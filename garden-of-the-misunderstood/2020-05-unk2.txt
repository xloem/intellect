everything i do will have the worst possible error in it, once. [the ambiguity in meaning here relates to variability] -karl
	[karl's emergency self patterns are now exposed and in danger]



goal: finish implementation of missing-inputs check.  appears complete?  misses call to function.
	choice splits burden.  considering greater-investment due to apparent equal burden.
		greater-investment parts:
			- check toJson() to fill unBroadcast.  is json string?
			- export the abandonTX function
			- add abandonTX to cli.js wiping on command
			- add abandonTX to api.js tail of tryBroadcastAl if successPossible == false && unBroadcast.length nonzero.
				note: block already exists
			- what would work is an abandonUnbroadcast function; it would happen _after_ saveUnbroadcast in tryBroadcastAll
