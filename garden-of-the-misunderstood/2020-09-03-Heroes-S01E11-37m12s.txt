I work for your father.
He sent me here to make you forget, like he sent me to your friend, and your brother, and your mother so many times.
He'll be here soon expecting that you won't remember anything.
But it is very important that you do.
Tell me, Claire, can you keep a secret?

<Claire has a special ability.  Her father covers up the people who have them; this is unknown to her. [obviously, everyone has a special ability ... .]>
