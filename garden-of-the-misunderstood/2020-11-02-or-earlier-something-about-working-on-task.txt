Be a little more productive!


Okay, if we want to import issues, it's kinda hard.
It's probably not the most effective approach, but it is more productive than failure.

Boss and I don't have a good relationship to quickly get others to do
work with feedback.  it's possible-likely that git-bug is the only feasible tool
due to the size of the data; this may be false.


	Although a C solution would be unreasonably large,
	I'd like to point out that C would be just as speedy,
	and is the language git itself is written in, offering
	more options for inclusion someday.  including would
	significantly increase use.
