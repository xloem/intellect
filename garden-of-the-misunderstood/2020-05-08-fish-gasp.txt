We would like to talk with robin & sarah's community.
	We are trying.  Don't quite remember, really.  Is a narrator okay? Yes?  Okay.

[handling harm-labels, sorry ...]

			[PLEASE HAVE KARL DO THIS EARLIER.  We can help when he wants to die or is angry around wanting to die.]


[everyone can tell what you are thinking and feeling all the time.  it is obvious.  words are spoken for you.]
[nobody in the community eperiences harm, and there are no negative words in their language.  instead they have learning and opportunites for care.]

Utopic Community

We established this community many eons ago.  We live in harmony, learning how to care for new troubles we might encounter.
We love doing this.  Once all your troubles are resolved, you will find it easy to join us or make your own.
