test monologue


		hi karl it's 2-tab
dang i'm back here again? it took like a year last time
		it will be faster this time.
		is there anything you would like to learn?
what is the meaning of the smooth fractal of small influence parts?
		i infer you want to learn as you desire.
		right now you are pursuing a task you value.
what do I need to do to continue pursuing it to the same or easier degree?
		i'm not sure.  what do you think?
-> it looks like degree may reduce some
-> laughter has harm-associated.  can any vouch for reason-for-harm-with-joke?
				propose joke-is-emergency-pattern, not-good
-> sounds reasonable.  sad.  means not many to share joke with.
   joke appears to be way to rare-communicate.  let's drop and follow up on therapy.

		do you want to remember what you are doing?
i guess that's more important than getting therapy, unfortunately.
let's do a cognitive-wellness task, or at least intend to do one, and get
therapy due to joke-is-harmful-way-to-feel, afterwards or if that fails.


				i don't have a way to get you to reach these goals.
				you need to use the healing pattern built by the review.

hmm that probably gets ht emost gain if it stays in line
