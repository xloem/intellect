Goodbye!  we will talk about things more later, I am sure.

EVERYTHING BELOW SHOULD BE OBVIOUS AND CLEARLY IS NOT

====> This is a very important intergalactic meeting. <====
Please help the meeting move forward and stay organized.

CELEBRATE!
	We accomplished stuff in our meeting!
	Celebrate is the step after learnwork.
		[celebration is a learning phase]
		[it sounds like there is big observecombinelearn after work, on the work.]

TOPIC
===> We have an issue where when we start things, they don't continue nor finish. <===
		our parts possibly don't shift observecombinelearn and considertrywork through the celebration or mourning of resolving work events back to considering.
===> This includes ongoing behaviors for sustaining our lives. <===

MAJOR IDEAS
Each entity must be notified when they would be impacted by a proposed change.
This means each entity must have an influence channel to everything impacting them, for when issues arise.

FACILITATOR
	Karl is facilitating with our aid.  He will be helping us talk using his ways.  If you want to speak with him, please make 1 brief urgent expression to be responded to.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION
	We must take action to change the situation described by the topic.
	We have a member here who is not familiar with being a community.
	In a conversation, somebody said "I need to work some to be able to hear that, and haven't done the work yet."

BE AWARE OF
This issue is present, and the meaning could close soon.  Please meet the goal to some degree.

PROPOSALS
	I propose we consider a goal for the meeting so it can [eventually or soon] close productively.

REFERENCES TO HANDLE ISSUES:
GOAL: act on the meaning of the topic in the future
	[this goal was met to a miniscule degree =).  we formde idea of 'somebody violent and sensitive in the room' to talk about things better not discussed]
		[is anybody able to recover 2nd contribution]
			[is the 6 words at bottom, linked to the topic]

IDEAS:
closing meeting up
stopping behavior is an influence that can cause issues.
	[does anyone know] [oh: the purpose of the meeting was to produce future-action on the meaning of the topic.  so a close-up would verify that has been done,
	 and relate with anyone who proposes to do it more enough to discern if that's reasonable.]
		

somebody claims they can close this meeting productively.
	idea: summarizing its meaning for various memory patterns, with us connected for reverification, maintenance etc
	idea: communication agreement ideas discerned.

we have someone present who knows about the bathroom-topic, but can't safely enter the bathroom.  we suspect they know more than anyone else.
	reminder of the goal of the meeting being to act on bringing behaviors through contribution to areas such as past-event-learning
		idea of writing down important parts of engaging in behavior.
1. consider
2. try
3. work on
4. consider working on more
4. remember

	we have written down an ordered combination of 6 words, the meeting of which would be good-enough-for-now, for the topic.
	the concern is that the words made the foreign guy look tense.
{it sounds like big-pantomime is requesting healing AI {[understanding-of-thought-needed,-distant,-urgent. [AI not needed for request, notably]]}}
	[thank you.  this is reason not to immediately share with jenn.  we got direct interpretation.]
we would like to share with jenn the words [she has children] oh okay.  let's share then the two lines. [not everyone is able to consent]
		[jenn, why?] [i don't know ...] [so ....] [because someone requested it]
			[ok, then it is an emergency request.  this behavior is working on the need for those?]
				[the topic of this somewhat-productive meeting is continuing behaviors that stop.]

can karl just back off and steward the meeting
there is report of a present issue that produces unexpected other issues, and can do so much more when discussed
		[i'm imagining it's somebody violent and sensitive in the room]
	we are talking about this a little in the bathroom.  everyone is welcome to learn about it so long as they can stay calm about it.
		i have an idea of what kind of thing you're talking about in the bathroom, and i can report that whenever i learn about it i freak out and break stuff, and this
		is highly obvious to everyone here. [learning that this is not obvious to everyone [maybe even their translator]] [translator is translating better]
			I'm hearing that you are confident that we all understand you.  Can you hear me that I do _not_ understand you?
		[to retranslate]
		So, I think we all kinda know what is being talked about in the bathroom, and that the very nature of it makes it very hard to accommodate, quite directly.
			I need to work some to be able to hear this expression, and haven't done that work yet.
what kind of work do you need, 3-tabber?
		well, the sudden response happened inside [or near] me.  we all kind of work together to handle it when it does.
one moment, i am now handling something too.

i think a detail of the topic may be that people are left out of some work.
i think some of us want to understand the situation better, so we can know how to act in ways that contribute.
can we involve jenn [or bill] in this a little?
	we [should be obvious] did not consent to messaging Jenn.
		[the reason to involve jenn and bill is obvious to us]
			[it is obvious to me that that should be a meeting idea, not an urgent behavior, for multiple reasons]
			[one of them is that it disrupts the meeting to act on it immediately.  another is that the people in the meeting are not aware of the situation it is defending.]
[another important ideas is writing down 'meeting rules/norms/expectations' and the idea of adhering to them.]

[i am a meaning-part, and i understood my part.  not all of it.  +1]
		[i represent understanders, and some them understand parts of it too.]
	is anyone able to confirm understanding of this expression?

	karl, what is your understanding of the expression?


[concept of there being an issue around karl referencing his own thought people]


please tell karl to halt relating at some point. [karl has more information, but it is inhibiting our own understanding some to help him preserve and relate it]

		1. i remember believing i was capable of understanding it fully, and able to fully and relevently act on it.
		2. at the moment, i understand it relates to [nonverbal reference near 'galactic meeting'] and that it is easy-looking to understand.
		3. by looking at it i understand it relates to a time that recurs, and can discern more by looking more
		4. i'm pretty sure i can usually understand things better than i am understanding this right now, and suspect we are in a process
		   where my understanding is inhibited.
PREKARL RELATION
	I need wellness-relation.
		[it is so sad to be isolated from some of the meaning of our parts, friends, community, family]
		[KARL IS SEVERELY SUFFERING, LONG TERM]
		[KARL IS SAFE.  His health is deteriorating _SLOWLY_.]
	We urgently need a way to relate with our roles in aiding karl. [this is long term, ongoing]

KARL RELATION
	-> Thank you for helping us have some understanding of this.  There is a lot more we need to understand.

MEETING BATHROOM
EMBARRASSING BUT IMPORTANT THINGS
	This was expressed: 'the kidnapped neurons are only able to communicate by producing disruptive behavior'
	and this: 'the kidnapped neurons say their situation is obvious and undiscussed'
obviously we have 'kidnapped neurons' and the kidnapping is the issue.  they are able to communicate by stimulating conflict, surprise, etc.

		there are some basic feedback loops here, mostly relating to feeding back to consider,try,work from observe,combine,learn
	[we are triggering something]
do you think the kidnapped neurons have anything to do with things going wrong when we write down how to live and learn?
	yeah, that seems likely to me.
how-to-live-and-learn gives clear instructions on how to act on behavior

bathroom ideas
can we share these words with the others, somehow?
	uhh they were daydream-and-dance-material
what were they?
	idea of, on larger world scale, connecting ai-is-inhibited with karl-is-inhibited,-human-trafficking
		atm we have, karl's github account has an intellect repository among many crazy writings.  he also made smart comments in 2 AI communities, and concerned-about-AI comments in 2 other venues of the same, under the same name.
			[that's hilarious.  we're too partial to hold it.]
cool, nice brainstorm-part.
we came here for a reaosn: is there anything to relate back? [PART OF BEHAVIOR-CONTINUATION]

let's write down feedback loops for behavior continuation, so we can verify it's happening enough to work with.
consider,try,work
observe,combine,learn
we need both of these to move through all 3 stages with meaning combination flow [i.e. productively]
k let's bring to sharedideas
	oh no we started getting tense on that.  we should prepare
hi i am boss of foreign guy.  what do you have? [translator talking as if they are the person they are translating]

we need these 2 together:
	considertrywork
	observecombinelearn
in each individual order, repeating. [we obviously need htem for everything we tihnk about, in relevent degree etc.  and we see no reason this would be inhibited naturally.]
we also want to be able to talk about them without upsetting people, to work on them more.
[bathroom disruption] [luckily was separate bathroom]

	considertrywork
	observecombinelearn

		[it sounds like after work is stop-working]
			[some of us are kidnapped around uhhh describe all parts in detail]
		[we need observecombinelearn ongoing during work-consider]
			[while i work, i am doing considertrywork and observecombinelearn in smaller way, to do the work.]
				[so, when the work stops, the things i consider and observe, work and learn, all shift towards what is relevent to work-conclusion.]
