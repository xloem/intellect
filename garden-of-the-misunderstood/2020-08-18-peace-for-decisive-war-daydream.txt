what is the 'enormous unexplored pilgrimage' that a war explores?
	roughly the space of conclusions that would be found if the
	assumptions of the opposing sides of the war were held in harmony
		[okay, that makes sense.  it implies that peaceful people will dominate existence, though.]

military peacemaking: the final, most decisive way to win a war
	you make peace with the leaders of the opposing side
	for real
	using military certainty
for example, you might move from killing the enemy leader, to
kidnapping them and a sympathetic mediator, and forcing them into
discussion with your leader
then you might move from that, to putting tanks in front of any disruptions
preventing them from meeting peacefully on their own.  you could force the meeting
on to their schedule, if you wanted to.
roughly you can instantly get them to mediate if you attack all the things
stopping that, etc
as you get better you can do it without weapons, but the military might not like that

note: peacemaking produces lasting defense of the nation, because the opposing leaders do not retain desire to threaten
