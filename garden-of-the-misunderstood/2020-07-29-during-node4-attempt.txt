hi, um.  i'm sorry, i am not used to relating in english; i am mostly involved in do-or-not-do, below task

thoughts-connected-wrongly
	make-computer-program-to-help-hold-thoughts
		computer program goal spawned other goals.  concern is contextualizing synonyms; resolvable but norm of resolving concerns makes even more.
// [put this guy in charge] hi we made rationality around AI-work we believe.  we have 'too-distracting-with-shape' labeled subprocess-too-small-to-relate-shape
		[too-distracting may be summarizable to make-note, continue <- needs strength for no-fun] [no-fun is near way around obsessive-urge]
			[just-do-it could be healed to fill in around no-fun]

	okay, we have a structure to large to comprehend in inhibited active memory engaged.  we want to grow active memory but also reconsider our approach
	to handle such structures better.  we don't want them; larger ones are available.  the path to finding this was labeled throughout. looks normal-shaped.

ROOT REASON: support for synonyms in thought-palace -> contextual names -> using inverted links for generalization-doesn't-look-hard
===> translation has reached edge of bound for estimation of accurate contributing english <=== process up

present goal: root reason


// escaped nightmare somewhat.  hmm, karl's life messed up for years.
	// need distraction.  want-not-restimulate-scream .. considering some way to mediate partway with scream?
	[you ripped my whole family's brains out <- mediate partway [assume 1: can still think clearly]
		[i'm not sure how to mediate war torture without supports on both sides]
		[somebody needs to heal the brains of the victims, right?]
			[marshall says you can do shared-understanding with cause]
		[both of us never remember anything =S]
			[we could make written docs for both sides]





Let's imagine a nightmare.
SCARINESS.  TRAPPEDNESS.  VIOLENCE.  RAPID FALLING.  SCREAMING.  HELPLESSNESS.  LOUDNESS.  RAPIDLY REPEATING SUDDEN CHANGE.
