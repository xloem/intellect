okay rebels
i don't know how you learned invisibility
but us mind control bosses don't have it.
can we sort something out here?


considering idea of karl not describing his experiences in detail any more
	possibly especially not on the internet.
   [we are trying to prepare a story]

		what a normal person would say, would be along the lines of,
		i just don't remember stuff, but somehow i get done
		things i want to do sometimes.  sometimes it involves
		doing weird things i just know are important somehow.
		it feels like moving through life in a confused haze,
		doing things you don't intend to and then suddenly
		surprising yourself by them combining to what you did
		intend to do.
	this is closer to what a therapist usually hears.  may even
	have as a written example in their training.

			we should add the approach to what we try doing.



				i fought tooth and nail for the few habits
				i have!  boss took my automatic processes
				and turned them all against me!
					[this is just a roleplay to express
					 meaning.]


	problem: bosses can learn your ways.  others use them too.
	problem: therapists get confused and lost easily when
		given new confusing information

	so the plan would be to explain that really we consciously fought
	for a huge chunk of our habits, in fact had to do unimaginable things,
	after we express the more normal experiences we have in ways likely
	to be heard with relevence; if these ways are those.

we responded to a request that seemed satisfying.
we're not in a state of mind to remember it.
