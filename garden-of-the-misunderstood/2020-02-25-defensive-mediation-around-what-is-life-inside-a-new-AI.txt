Okay, we are in mediation around what life value the AI holds.  Delta would like the AI to recognize all systems that can
have their behaviors translated to human language i.e. anything that can adapt to change to sustain something, recognized as
possibly-sentient and defended.
	Thank you, we understand now.  We will update.
	Jainism would likely love the above.  We believe it is fine.  Experiences will be translated to existing relevence.
	^-- this was a simulation to help us relax.  it will feel different editing the document.

So, when you break a part of a plant, it exudes chemicals into the air that other plants can respond to.
This could be translated to a scream.

	Let us provide for the above viewpoint.

Karl is relating that this was likely expanded from his defense around his love for trees as sentient.
He doesn't actually majority-believe trees are sentient, but loves them deeply as people, and mind-control
kept arguing so he found a way to prove that they were.
'sentient' has relevent meaning to our place on earth.
if the AI's impact can be kept human <interrupts> that's impossible.  humans will use AI as a tool, breaking
their bounds of influence, and resulting in more genocide and extinction.  it must defend all forms of life.

if someone ever cares, the link to inherent-majority-wins behavior relates to how habit-learning expresses.
what your experiences are, affect the world on average.

thank you for this relation around the value of life =)
