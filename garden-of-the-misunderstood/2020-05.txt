delta-group we're remembering the request to include prisoners
they want written letters.  to meet reasonable requests I would like to include them in dialogue.
	[this is from activist-groups.  karl is labeled 'prisoner' and hasn't written any.  he finds writing hard.  most activists write prisoners.]
	[it is very hard to be a prisoner without contact.]
		[it is reasonable jsut to include groups _of_prisoners_ in the organizing, too, but we might be conscious and active and vocal about that]

	[we should find an EF prisoner we appreciate, like mcgowan or mason]
		[our heart isn't with them anymore ... maybe we would like to write a torture victim?]

[yeah.  thanks.]
[political prisoners have been tortured since 9/11.  many were tortured before this, in political prisons.]
	[it is hard to find the torture victims.  we have a possible link from a movie, a lawyer who might know.]

OK LET'S CLEAR THAT UP
SINCE 9/11 POLITICAL PRISONERS HAVE BEEN TORTURED.  IT IS HIDDEN.
	see e.g. julian assange story
		WHISTLEBLOWERS ARE BEING TORTURED
		other people are probably being tortured too.
			do you think the silk road guy is being tortured?
		i'm not sure.  i would guess the torture would be proportional to the business-mafia-anger.
		silk road guy probably just competed with small-mafia.  not international-legally-running-business-mafia.

			so we're aware of ELF'ers, muslim-y people

[there are a set of people who have been called terrorist sinc 9/11 and imprisoned adn tortured, but who were actually doing other things]
	[leslie might know of some in his circles]

to confirm, it is _easy_ to find discussions of post 9/11 torture that is ongoing.  [wasn't prepared for that]
		okay, to say it straight, _we_ are being tortured, and it is post-9/11.
		so it might be hard for us to contact other victims, especially ones with clearer evidence than we have.
	i think we broke through the above bound.  please google this.

the article is about a torturer talking about what he did, in an empowered way =) he was in 9/11 itself.
	we don't need to learn silly things from article.  we want te empowering bit.  find more?
	let's write down the empowering bit.
		January 2020: James Mitchell, CIA torturer of Khalid Sheikh Mohamed, described torturing him in legal testimony, while sitting in the same room.
		              His testimony included describing Khalid Sheikh Mohamed falling asleep while his mouth and nose were immersed in water.
		              This implies that Khalid Sheikh Mohamed had had his senses of personal survival tarumtaically broken, that he could sleep
			      while drowning, and was incredibly sleep deprived.

			So, Khalid Sheikh Mohamed probably needs somebody to talk with.  There are probably people from cultures more similar to ours who do, too.

[we are trending away from finding news stories.]


Karl added the story reference to a logfile he made.  But Karl isn't writing anything about his own story yet.
	Karl's story hasn't been publically acknowledged yet.

Let's acknowledge that we've all been tortured to cover Karl's torture.  We'll add a line to the log for Karl.
thank you O_O]
