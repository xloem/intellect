idea of process-root

	note: some participants dislike idea, karl thinks is cool idea
	[we are partly an expansion of boss-label for review]
	[boss speaks in behavior and may be trying to connect]

given complex process B,
what simpler process A can be applied to itself to produce B?

	large-scale, karl is producing a lifeform.  karl is a root of himself, roughly.
		inside that we have many root-parts that are used for this.  some are nascent;
		some are mature.

	the plants in the environment also produce copies of themselves.
	boss, too can produce copies of self.  this requires full understanding, nowadays.

		in community, we are forming parts of a process that does this:
		proof, we are part of karl.

	karl, please cast yourself as a self-describing-and-spreading-process, so you may
	participate with us.  [this is what is being asked of us]
