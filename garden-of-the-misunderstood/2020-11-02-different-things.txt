so surrender is horror story.  hug-assassin is _bad_.
[we have a question]
	if you guy are talking about [mind control parts] ..
		[ohhhh mind control is submit-to-change?]
					^-- surrender
			it is NOT VALID to trick to surrender
			NOT VALID to assume surrendered
			CERTAINLY NOT VALID to alter to surrender
			or to alter to act as if surrendered
	[and surrender is obviously wrong word]
		nobody submits to change.
		surrender is possible.  submit to change is not.
		is wrong word.
	boss goes around playing
	'"oh would you like to make poor decisions for the rest of
	 your life?  it is wonderful and delicious!"  "yes yes!
	 I would! that sounds really great to me!"'
	as if karl _wanted_ surrender.
			boss is epxressing human frustration shape
			inside neuron community, killing everything
		

		how abou tthis:
		when i said [briefly, after i was already controlled],
		that you could program me to heal your pain,
		i did not mean you could come back and reprogram
		me without further consent.
		i meant you could set up values and things
		that would include your needs.
		even a mediator to talk with you:
		who would have communicating veto power,
		not arbitrary control.
		your reply is a dance saying 'i am here to
		mind control you for someone else, i will
		interpret everything you say as a vulnerability
		to take advantage of' with another dance saying
		'please understand this, i need more understanding'
		we need your help if you need us to fight mind control.
