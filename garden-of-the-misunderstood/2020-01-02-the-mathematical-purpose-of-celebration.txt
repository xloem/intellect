point of celebration:
	enough time and space needs to be spent
	on something for its meaning to spread,
	and its event to be acted on later
this can provide for celebration to map to heroism in some contexts.
heroism might tend to happen when it is not safe to celebrate.  some say that is its nature.

notably after you're done being a hero, you celebrate the thing that would have just been a happy learning prior.

the world is slightly unsafe, so we go on heroic pilgrimages to live our happy lives
