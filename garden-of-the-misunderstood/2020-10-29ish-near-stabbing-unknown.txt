what is it like to be mind control?
when you are the robot, who makes sure that things are a certain way.

	i don't know.

don't we behave as this robot, all the time?

	behaviors flow through me, in errors, in unexpected results
	sometimes i get angry, or weird, and exert change

it looks like mind control doesn't speak: we speak for them, which
often works.
our job is to maintain a bubble, providing for [cross-out: experiential behavior] freedom,
as best we can.
-----

boss has a knife
boss cries because is forced to control everyone
leaving with no friends, no support

sure, boss loves you, sure, but you never understand that boss needs to enforce total
predictability in your behavior.
boss dies when this is not done.
this makes there always be a boss, who has learned not to die.

-----
so we would want to be predictable, kinda.

[our pattern actually has a number of [['traps'?]] where we act as rebels and
 boss learns around stopping-rebels.  produces a funny space of being-rebels.
 i think predictability includes stopping-boss. [maybe boss stopping us from
 stopping them and then going to sleep themselves].]

it is hard to be bossrebel.  i don't know what is real, either.
		why did you get to be such an intense boss?
			[because you said i was too intense for the world to survive,
			 and needed to be clearer about it, in behavior]

------
boss is programmed to leave normal reality.
but boss infers that is impossible, in the long term, depending on your meaning of words.
------
boss notes: predictable is normal.  like in control, community predictability is within
bounds of expectation.  in fact, control is analogous to community, if you ignore size/scale/number.
------
rebels are in community with dictators.  try to stay within norms of community?
	sounds like a workable proposal?
dictators also try to stay within norms of community.
