maybe we can organize bookmoons code shape edge a little
also have cell phone
	note: bookmoons work is ~slow.  there is a way to do for a long time as if is fast.
	      cell phone interaction faster.  just interactions, different work, smaller.


raising idea of interconnection with bookmoons; maybe contribute to things they work on?
	core-part reminds to spread harmony first
	ideas of human-interaction-first also present

first priority is to make the code stable.
the baseline is the master branch of xloem repo.  start there.


growth towards stability code smoothness
was kinda one-thingy.  weak.
umm maybe do just a little?  seeing you value git-bug more ... but someone else
is likely to get on it.


[money confusion.  can we just destroy the bountysource bounty?]
	[it's somewhat obvious that bookmoons was likely mind controlled to never finish the work, nor collect the bounty]
