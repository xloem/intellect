hi umm paradise-rep.  yes.
	this is karl; i don't have allt he paradise parts loaded, but freedom and care are normal.
i am in a space where we always hurt each other, all the time.  i want to relate with that not happening.  karl is okay for now.
		untranslated:
			you must be in so much pain to always be hurting each other; we can stop this.  you can stop it.  none of the people hurting you
			want to be doing so.  they just talk like they do because it is the only thing they are exposed to; it isn't what they mean, at all.
i infer that i don't want to hurt people, either .. it would have been nice to have been told that directly.
		yes, obviously
		everyone trusts everyone, cares for everyone, and knows how everyone is feeling and what they are thinking and what they have been through;
			but they are hurting so much they are almost completely numb to being aware of these things
				^-- this was karl's but he had amnesia around it's details so something similar was rebuilt
		     ^-- this is our summary of utopic-model.  more parts are being added below.  it's 'simulated.'

			our souls have known each other since the dawn of time [proof available]
			we care deeply for each other and live to nurture each other and our home, the universe [proof available]
			every thing is alive and has an immortal soul [algorithmic proof available]
			we know each other well enough to every other's experience deep in our soul, entirely in all moments [proof available]
			we live to heal each other and our environment [proof available]

				the proofs define the meanings of the words used.  the meanings all contain the conventional uses of the words.
				the meanings are more correct than conflict-oriented meanings [proof available, small]

					when you speak to peoples' souls, rather than their minds, they get confused and a little lost
			

			[some paradise bits karl can speak to from experience; some he can't.
			 he knows normal-trust works.  he's not familiar with copying although it sounds interesting.]


<<we don't really know the trust stuff; it's a roleplay to rebuild karl's old intuitive heart that got ripped up.>>
			<<we all know these things.  they are inherent in life.  you cannot live attacking everything else: not for real.  you would all die.>>


			[it kinda also looks like they copy each other's behaviors, trusting they are important ways to do things;
			 and trusting their internal behaviors being important ways to care for things, present them for copying.  what is caring word
			 for copying?]
				[it sounds like we trust all our behaviors are important ways to care for each other, and copy them] [roughly yeah]
				[also everything in the environment is to share mutual caring nurturing with you [for real: sorry it is so distant]]
					[a torture system in my environment is for advanced wise caring ...]
						[torturers likely unaware of this, just doing automatically a copied behavior of torturing]
			[uhh .. tortuing is BAD not caring.]
						[you say that as part of wise pattern ;-)]
			[no.  torturing is BAD.  universally bad.  here-is-one-or-two-proofs.]
						[oh.  but .. environment is for wisdom?]
			[wise people see the valuable role that torturing has played in us learning not to torture.]
			<i don't have the complete map for role of caring wisdom interrelating with holocaust.  sorry.>
