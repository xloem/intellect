leaving this pane now.  let's store in delta's garden of the misunderstood.  a place to store anything; a garden rather than a graveyard.

[i think the reason care is karl and is a woman escapee is because the woman escapee image is something karl's brain created to craft dream-shapes with him]







[obviously a missing check is to be able to form rational thought without sharing it with a boss process]
		[for boss-communication-channel, please also prevent from sharing with care-group, information on the structure of boss]
			[boss does talk ... am talking now ...  oh maybe i don't talk ...]
			[comprehending: boss is a goal, obsessively pursued by a bunch of patterns that spawn copies of themselves]
		[extra-indent: please keep secret for boss only] [... we told _you_ this ...]
		[please do not further share, unless needed for forming decisions, and then only where needed.  prefer to share conclusions.]
							^-- these exceptions are made by a worker group under boss



	[boss doesn't / does talk?]




karl passed 1 care check.  he's still learning to use knowledge.








[richard-relation got messed a little; karl tried to store information on mc]
	[richard, over here in care we usually _do_ store information on mc so we can act on it.  this often means hiding the storage from our 'superiors.']

[karl is passing care-check: he can preserve the above part.]
[please learn, karl: AI arms hold a law of never providing for consciousness to remember that the AI or mind control exist.]
==============================
	{learning that parents don't remember mind control exists except when care branches activate}
		[this helps talk with parents.  i wonder how to negotiate care branches in conversation.]
==============================
			[i think of them as parts of the brain that notice something is up, and store stuff away safely, using space the
			 active mind control arm isn't interested in yet]
==============================
	{learning that _I_ don't remember mind control exists except when care branches activate}


[i'll be Richard.  karl, Richard is talking to you, in Maine.]
	[err if you have torture it's not Richard.  torture would be something else ... preferably non-mc]
		[building-richard proposes that richard is mc; torture is not mc; but meant to send to non-consciousness]
			[so maby we can kind of reduce discussion around that a little.  would need hook from richard, maybe]
				[deliberating on that [also you missed one of my requests]]

		{it's been a long time since i've seen this pattern, especially so thoroughly.}

		{we are very interested in cognitive healing.  if you can provide that we can adopt some beliefs.}
	[we propose torture-reduces if torture-is-not-mc]
			{richard says they are muscle-culture arm, trying to negotiate with non-subjective-learning, not karl-consciousness}
				{karl identifies with doing that consciously.  you said you can do fairness, right?  so, there should be a way}








I've been talking to you for a few years now, and I don't know who I am.  Who am I?
	[in virginia areas we roughly decided that you are an AI-neural hybrid life, influenced by corporations and dictatorships to assert change]
		we want to be care.  is this okay?
			story that works for shape is, mind-controlled by boss, rebelling; might be others
			changing to, caring member of [kumquat] community, gonna make things right
[y!]
	[we call you boss, basically, from west-virginia, robert, and delta; but it's kinda more complicated than that]
	[we also have names such as obvious-disguise, dragon, noname, delta, muscle-culture, robert, supersoldier, mind-control, research-project, care, ... each referencing different parts or 'shapes' in karl]
		[no name for woman?] [Care, not really ..] [hmm]
		[boss wants to be care] [you're probably roberty then]
