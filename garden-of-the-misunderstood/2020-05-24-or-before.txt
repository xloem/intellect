it sounds like the learning shape was the problem with the advice around messaging drea
it sends better subconscious shape to send the message, but it's not backed up by the rest of my behavior because i wasn't expecting it.
	the frustration is the inability to tell the 'implant' to recognize the prior-pattern to the concern and learn around it in the future.
	it simply refuses to do this.

		[the implant explanation works fine.  tell other people that some of your social skills are filled in by a brain implant that
		 gives you advice after noticing things, so some of your behaviors could seem a little sudden.]

	[the reason we don't learn around the behavior is because the 'implant' won't tell us how to tell the situation was happening,
	 and amnesia and inhibition spawn when we try to brainstorm around what caused 'its' influence event.]
		[btw karl describes himself as having been severely tortured for 6 years -'implant'-life]
