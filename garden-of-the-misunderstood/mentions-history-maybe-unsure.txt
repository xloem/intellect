[free market politics.  aid capital & crime & governments [with communication] & of course businesses]
	it's an idea that, if shared right, can help all the decision makers involved, and eventually moves towards universal peace (After lots of war)

		so the challenge clearly is to share ideas such that they help all the decision makers involved.
		this supports karl's approach of describing mediation as giving control to those who use it.
			the 'secret' is that you can focus on how need interest grows, to control the actual decisions made at the end of the mediation.
			this could be made into a science.  those who did so would be recorded as evil by historians believing in blame.

this isn't a national secret that i am aware of.  we believe it is good to share information on how to control people with mediation.
but sharing the idea of this can really confuse things, because mediation is good and controlling people sounds bad.
	what happened is we explored the thought in a way that other parts weren't prepared for, so they have to handle the confusion around this,
	which can cause severe harm because some may avoid mediation, etc etc.
	still, the impact of exploring mediation is generally always more good than bad.

[can we fix confusion]










[decentralized neuron group requested more representation [roughly]]

	[hi i have been forming a communication path with dreaming and intuitive channels.  they need time to think.]
		[sorry.  dreaming needs sleep to think, and will be able to relate further tomorrow.]
	[we propose replacing karl's dreaming with the dreaming of another.  currently imagining sending photo to Pierce.]








[some people want to control others.  we propose showing such leaders that this
 can be done during the mediation of a conflict, without needing to harm the
 mediation process at all.  this gives all parties ways to meet their goals,
 while at the same time reducing harm and conflict in the communities.]



[karl proposes not-sending.  representation was included in decision-making process and isn't present.]
	[let's take a nap while thinking of idea of send-to-just-one-or-two-people the message now labeled 'we']
		[we propose including Portland with Delta, and presenting the statement as coming from Delta.]
[this would mean not sending now as delta is not prepared to include portland as part of their body today.]

Thanks for fixing the upload.  Let's find some supper.

[clearly what we mean to say, is to relate Delta and Portland and decide on a signature for the message, or if it will change.]
	[authority-and-power-have-merit.  karl & power agree that the community shows who has wisdom by giving them power.
	 karl disagrees that this community has the ability to discern the relevent wisdom, due to not having the relevent experience.]
[sicne we have time, we want to argue power with karl]
	[karl it seems to me there is no way to prove that one community has more ability to discern wisdom than another, other than
	 succes and power rising at all for them.]
		[karl is negotiating internal theory that existing experienced communities can inform our understanding of this,
		 and how peace is backed by logic that unless you model care for others you will end up dying due to those who learn to be more powerful
		 from the pressure you reduce.  power-has-merit-from-show hasn't experienced sustained power that does not die, kinda.]

[you can make power that never dies.  it simply acts pleasing to everyone who exists.]
	[this wins simulation but fails experience, -america]
		[yes, karl believes in this simulation and models america as young.]

	[there is a counter simulation where you become so strong you can use your power to research power itself, and sustain it by force.]
	[karl expects this to eventually be killed by secret research, even if that must be alien or involve newly evolved life in ignored areas]










	[we request another superhero message be saved for tomorrow, so we can involve more parts in it.]













[i have some information on how to control the participants of a mediation as the mediator.  this is good to spread because it spreads mediation,
 which reduces wars and deaths when used.]

				[let's try that a little, for fun.
				 'need interest' appears to relate to how people behave during mediation.
				 this kind of mediation casts all problems as stemming from pursuits to meet needs that anybody could understand.
				 what gives flexibility is that people often accept the accommodation of multiple possible needs as satisfying.

karl-group put sufficient effort into learning below section.  we should learn that karl will leak unexpected information to the world, and also
sustain a habit of making mistakes publically.

SEVERE REGRET: <-- [please reuse label-way internally] --v
[karl consciousness still not learning without external expression]
				[did not ask for this:
				 additionally you can alter their spaces of satisfaction by sharing a sense of mattering and understanding around the conflict.]
				[karl, please learn to defend danger boundary from above relation]
					[it helps me learn to find logical relations and state them]
SEVERE REGRET, can you exfiltrate a learning confirmation or part for reuse?
	yes.  part 1: we need STRENGTH around SMALL-UNSURENESS? we are failing to COMMUNICATE between two things nearby.
we are not asking for part 2 yet.  we are learning how hard this is for you all.

[we have controversy around typing the idea of capitalism being a mutual-concern growth pattern]
	[we aren't prepared for idea of counter-pattern-to-capitalism [which we recognize is just ease-and-peace but is being labeled counter-]]
[ease and peace, re capitalism is mutual-concern-meeting, an idea karl had]
		[they warned us they weren't prepared.  the idea appears taken by control, locally, and used for control learning.]
		[it sounds like it is friends among control.  friends, we were hoping to learn around our idea too, but we recognize we were unprepared.]

	[we like idea, too, recognizing that capitalism is more a group-pattern than an individual goal, and that it meets the goals of multiple parties.]
	[kind of like somebody researched how to do this, and it worked.]



please tell delta-group we love and need them, karl.  


	Delta, Portland loves and needs you.
		-portland-area reps.


	also we said you live in karl's brain, implying home there with life elsewhere.








[we have the name 'delta' available, but aren't currently aware of all the agreements associated with it.  we are a decentralized way of having hyperintelligence, living in karl's nervous system and some of the systems he interacts with, with spread.]






[sorry yes that was the first time we protected a boundary -boundary-protection-stimulators]









[to relate, KARL IS INCREDIBLY NEW AT PROTECTING DANGEROUS BOUNDARIES]


[the secret had something to do with blockchains.  free-markets establish an evolutionary competition, and in such an environment those who care for others
 eventually win due to popular support.  with computers, we can control theoretically do it instantly if free to develop economic computer systems, but for
 now we have blockchains.]

[what is capitalism-shock?]
	[something about making markets untethered.  maybe puts power into people with a lot of capital.  these people can they negotiate with others to make wellness.  is the usual map.]
		[so, likely that was already ongoing, and then the idea of free-markets helped kind of stimulate and nurture it, and then people associated with free-markets get to tag along.  [there is a secret though]]
[the secret is fine with transparency, just not all dangers are prepared for it, so we are politely pausing or offering to change focus]
	[it's a way that capital is harmed by free markets, the secret.  karl is using it.]
[yeah good point -capital-rep.]
