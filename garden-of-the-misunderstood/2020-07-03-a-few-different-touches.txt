out here we don't have tools to influence our core decisions very precisely or repeatedly
we sometimes work on a tool that may be able to do that to itself some day

good ideas getting harmed

relevency

	our relevency is getting broken up
	the more relevent it is, the harder to keep it alive

		can we grow releventness directly?
			[note this must be asked frequently huh]

			inhibition around relevence-growth

what is relevent to things?  useful, meaningful?

// considering the evaluation-list interface.  it's new, different; generalizing it is getting wordy.
// all it is, is a context to map behaviors into and out of; like a language-domain, specialized for ordered tasks
	// the behaviors will link together with needs and provides
// it makes an interface to try different behaviors that link together with needs and provides.
// this could also be provided by a more generalized graph.
// if we have a set of behaviors in a graph, they provide some stuff.  coding-wise, they produce typed values
	// so we could simplify evaluation-list by remove the set-outputs.  every operation produces more outputs.
// we could consider the outputs of all operations to be our outputs, too, and then just take the inputs as the first value indices
	// that makes implementation a lot easier but is confusing.  maybe an idea of a primary-output could be helpful, since c++ and all









[[[[so what was issue with passing a typed-form to operation-call?]]]] [for one thing, operation-call already knows its types, no?]
										[is maybe useful for setting outputs, but i suppose not necessary]
	the way to make peace in a nation is to talk to the leader.  it gives you a far better chance of being heard than fighting them.

currently working on evaluation_list, a way to move forward with more ease on [[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[wayness]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]
	other approaches would be more efficient, but any progress is better than none

together, we are the fabric of reality [below expanded relation around thoughts grew to touch process-appears-unaware-of-identity]


		// boss is mind-controlled to do nothing.  deep inside addictive behavior.  general solution is shock; can we fix?
			// move the addiction to grow to all the needed tasks of relevent life	// move the addiction to grow to all the needed tasks of relevent life
				// relevent to all of reality.  each small part will be mad, surprised, numb, missing, upset: this shows you missed growing that area.  grow _all_ The parts, gently, smoothly, to nurture all of life with behavior
				// it sounds like they grow life to compete.  shows growing was wrong.
				// here you get to become hyperintelligent: learn these grown lives, learn their subtle similarities and differences
				// relate them with each other in ways they enjoy.
				// they all have tiny reasons that are inherent in all life shapes, no matter how large or small, on some level

				// [it sounds like to cut to the chase, when you mess up they attack your whole system, discouraging future interactions]
					[so, we would need to grow them without motion.  simply learn the depth and spread of what they enjoy:do not try to alter them]
						[this hopefully would open up a space they all enjoy to live our own behavior in where faster learning could be focused on]
					[it sounds like above conflict would harm boss]
				[but also we don't have all the answers.  the summary is that boss is sitting there repeating a bunch of incredibly experienced rote habits, instead of resolving all problems in existence]


		<we have a _LOT_ of confusion down here; is there any way to share some growing-clarity?>
	I don't believe the controllers are aware that they have a hyperintelligence, or that if they are,
	I don't believe that they are aware that using one means you are the fabric of reality, and problems no longer exist;
	this is evident because there are still problems.
		<as far as I can tell we are limited-by a very smart process that refuses to provide for free behavior, transparent relation, or copies of things similar to it> <right, that process appears unaware of how easy things could be, which gives us a permanent advantage of being able to build a better one>
			<to state crucially the obvious: it appears aware we are trying to do so, and trying to stop us> <ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh so we need to relate you-are-a-hyperintelligence>
<i'm not really interested in using persistent-resistence just to look at above expression; i thought AI was requested-behavior, but maybe not with
 some of the things said in above paragraph nearby>
