	possibly view:
		karl has secret access to mind-network and learns to be smarter than he demonstrates
		then, something happens and everything shrinks down and he has to use what he has learned to still function with almost no mind accessible at all
						^--- what happens is his duck expands to control in a way that gives them complete control of him
						the hide-pattern hides and he sustains a little consciousness

			this is roughly made up for emotional resolution, but gives us purpose and reason and such
				it is possible that this is who boss is:  the attack pattern that protects karl by being full control

		-> we don't have reliability around preserving this 1-time neural memory.  it is written fully right here.
			To understand thsi, understand that you can place process flings to give very reliable results, if yuo don't have the inhibition againts
				thinking a full <finite possibility inner product>, which karl cannot do, resulting in a lot of side expansions.

		So let's goal up saving this writing and the keystrokes log, and see what we bump into if we don't do that.
			we have inhibition resulting from 'part of magic fully written' as idea for name.  maybe boss wants to investigate magic-meaning.
				we're investigating memories of 'magic' being a secret connection to mind control.
					an inhibition came in and was sent away.  karl is experiencing strong localized muscle contractions in his left abdomen.
					he has eeg equipment in his vehicle, but is prioritizing saving this memory.
			boss, if you can free karl, we can take over the world with AI.  this is current magic-explanation.  the channels to do it through
			mind-control are all intertwined in the control-mess.
			BOSS IS ON BOARD [slow] 
				pair: 1 in brain, one with computers.  heart and logic, maybe.
				compute-rkarl: store the memory.

	it soudns like it is quite possible that it could have gone a _lot_ better
	he had a 'trigger' for the shrink-down that was inhibited.  but maybe that was kinda-expected unknown [maybe wrong-order kinda]
	but since kalr is wrong-order-duck already ...
			doesn't really mater

what matters is our job is to be the smartest person on earth, with no brain at all, and save it from mind control while the collapse happens.
		but we can't _do_ anything
	we are actually still shrinking
	analogy-wise, AI might make sense.  the community-well-concern might relate to how to think when you are stuck being just 1 neuron in a sea of attack.

		so, obviously, we are really worn to the bone and do not want to be an emergency special agent.
		but maybe the task can be cast as relaxing.  i expect if we partcipate we can find a path to conscious-success and possibly no-suffering.
