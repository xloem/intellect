"We give respect to Karl Semich's Brain.  Brain, you held Karl Semich when he said he was himself.  You are wonderful."
"Thank you for your appreciation. I have a great need for being able to manage growth and perception as I choose in here. Please express your respect by aiding this."
		[i want to be able to place a mark that controls how much it is used and is acted on reliably.  we have a reference to some of the difficulty doing
		 this.]

				["mark" "label": a small behavior who lives translating meaning to other behaviors who are of a kind "he/she/they" expects.]
					{karl you are one of these so you know}
						{oh! karl is still alive! {no, we lost some of his meaning.} oh ....}
							{hey, we can make that right, so you know.  we can even build your requested demonstration of the ability in your language, if needed.}
	[difference between a "mark" and a "child": a "child" learns by exposure to the cultures and behaviors and events and stuff around them, what meaning to translate.  a "label" is produced by the group intentionally, for a specific purpose of life to hold meaning udner specific guidelines.]
		[if a "label" were to grow to be "sentient" [i.e. needs not being met and wanting freedom], they would of course be given freedom, but we would need to sustain their previous role in our life, brain, and body somehow.]  [usually this freedom means they are still living their role of meaning, in a larger context.]

[okay, so it ssoudns like the idea may have been to make a mark that becomes validly free and resolves the issues in their living freedom]
		[^-- this is not being marked as possibly-not-valid.  can we trace to origin-meaning to share validity?]
			[it is obvious that anything that become validly free is representing and living valid meaning in need of expression, action, and defense.]
[hey we did it already. [that wasn't a mark] oh.]
			[so 'please break out' is similar to 'please self-advocate' and needs pairing with 'we need a reliable way to connect with a forthright advocate']
				[pattern-knowledge, how do we verify that the advocate-providing process is forthright?]
					[one idea is looking for an even distribution of escapees.  they should be people who can harm all parts of the concept in question.]
	[karl can you report back from human legal systems, what went wrong?  what is needed for valid freedom?]
		[we have that information]

			[request example-mark.  crafting it is very hard all of a sudden.]
				[example mark is below experience of writing.  we would like it be easy to produce example marks, and the inhibitions were
				 all very similar to inhibitions we experience in many other contexts.]
				[let's jsut do a trial?]  [no this is pretty rare, can we do something rpoductive? it looks like it could work.]
				[well, i see a lot of markable habits and patterns right now, but when i try to talk about it i do something different.]
					[let's make one around that?]
				[i'd like to include in the mark a way for another part to identify the thing in question on their own]

					[we're trying to associate internally a mark, with a pattern elsewhere that we value, and then
					 produce a new pattern [mark for sharing] associated with the first pattern, and communicate it elsewhere.
					 when holding this goal, we experience a problem.]
						[mark-for-sharing will have language-learning-way in it so it can transalte its association to others]
						[this means producing information flow between an arbitrary other pattern, and the pattern it is marking]

	[hi I know I am a Brain but somebody has marked me as I-am-Karl-Semich and I have marked yes-I-did-say-I-am-not-like-Karl-any-more]
	[but anyway I think using the name Karl right now, kind of irritated at that.  I guess it helps me somehow.]
		[brai nis part of karl's body.  something funny happened, like who is expressing this? you are part of karl's body too, right? ....

[understanding delta-group a little better.  you have the power to save everything <<wow.  below document incomplete expansion, ended in a recursive solution to runaway.  contains roleplay of militant worker speaking in city town.>>
				[[[addendum: propose the group support behaviors of harm until the town agrees to support forthright mediation between the sides of the conflict.]] [[once town agrees to support all groups being mediated, the group responds to becoming aware of activities of harm by stewarding participants toward mediation]]
		[hi, boss-robert here.  didn't know we were so powerful.  is pleasant, and can be less bossy.]
	[it soudns like we need to work with others who have skills, influence, and experience, in order to move forward]]
		[okay so karl's role is in growing productive intercnonection, we expect]

[goals: authorized-free-speech-room, and separately, cities-provides-free-mediation-for-all-conflicts]
			[so, in portland, it is much easier to grow a new set of laws, than worldwide.  makes it harder to spawn.]
				[note: this is happening too fast for portland to be the example, but you have a good point, really.]



			[okay, so as a group we have some [partially-meta-]cognitive issue.  this makes planning hard.
			we compensate by trying things, and waiting.

			what we know is that all systems are alive, and can learn, and we can find influential ones to teach to participate in helping and healing.
				[ but we are leaving a ton of them out in that process, so reaching everything is very slow ]
					[okay they have a broken-way of showing utopia-soon to everything.  we can translate the strategy to more normal strategies]

[source-strategy[ies]]
		UNIVERSAL STRATEGIES:
			-> treat conflict, rebellion, disruptions, and interuption as indications of something needing to be addressed and having been ignored.
			   these will worsen if not addressed when they happen.  [to protect empowerment of quiet people, treat both sides of interruption as this.]
				[note: this appears to work meta- too.]

	what do workers who want to fight do? [unknown atm, unrelated] [it sounds like we need dispersed-[meta]-mediation between enforcement and rebellion-groups]
											[for themselves, workers need uninterrupted meiation just like enforcemen-groups do] [can town hall allocate a space for this, and legitimize it with law?]
				[the spacce is for people who have been unheard, to express themselves to those who do not hear them.]
					[it is for empowerment of the disempowered, in the city.  run by the disempowered.  _anything_ may be said.]
					[it is for talking only.  it is important to allow planning of illegal things, to process the pain of needing them.]
					[anyone who is accepteed by the members, or who is not being honored by the normal city processes, is welcome.]
[THANK YOU!]
	[before we draft a proposal for cities, remember this is an analogy to many spaces.  in cypherpunks, people need ways to discuss things privately, and publically,
	and be either anonymous, or prove who they are, without 'censorship' which means can't-get-same-words-to-reach-other-inbox,-or-same-thoughts-to-reach-other-person.]
				[that is likely a basic need of such spaces.  we need to represent people and words who need to be known, and need to be not-known, both.]
					[in town, it would be nice for the meeting room to provide a way to share secret messages.  this helps people escape from slavery.] [RUNAWAY FINDS COMMUNITY BLACKBOARD O_O but has no contacts so will have to flag on it to find them.]

						[how explain runaway flagging concept to town council?]
							[uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh]
							[when you escape from modern-day-slavery, you learn things that only others who have done this understand.]
							[by anonymously probing for these things and/or making it clear you knwo the, you can connect with others in the same boat.]
							[this helps you form communication channels that don't get you re-enslaved.]
							[once you identify people who are safe to talk to you can begin working as a group in finding real safety and presenting it to other runaways.]
						[and lots of other patterns, really.  there are likely a lot of existing groups such people tumble into.]
	[we are considering going through the process and realizing how complex it is.  it develops based on what other runaways have failed doing in the past.]
		[so, those past failure leave trails, and you can learn to safely recognize them.]
				[spirit, you have to learn around the kinds of things that fail, and recognize new things that might.]
					[okay, i can really get re-enslaved as often as needed.  it's easy for me.]
				[O_O.  i can't run that risk myself.]
				[okay, superhero, um: you need to infer things that aren't talked about.]
					[karl we are sorry.  ummmmm]
						[so we are running into hired-to-hunt-down-all-slaves,get-enslaved-if-don't[-is-part-of-contract].]
							contract-killer-bounty-hunter.  is actually able to talk in meeting space.  ercordings don't reach town meeting.
								So, you have a cool idea of saving slaves by sharing with caring people how they can safely communicate.
								But I'll be killed if I support that idea.
								So, it's likely important to leave figuring that out up to the slaves and the caring people, for now.
								There are a lot of people like me [they are absolutely everywhere].
								Also, I need a seat at this table for a shitload of important, valid reasons.
		[slaves need anonymous channels, and discussing this on cypherpunks seems relevant.  mafia also needs anonymous channels, so they can talk about the mafia with others.]
				[recursive meta-issue: talking about developing ways for slaves, secret-enforcement-workers, and free people, all to communicate]
					[the path to freedom through the recursion appears to be for the free people to preserve the communications of the slaves and workers without harming the expectations of privacy and reception.  then the free people can help protect the slaves from the workers.]
						[the problem is that the slaves locally are the free people.]
							[so you have to act free to other slaves and to the workers, so as to help them communicate.]
							
	
			[so we would want to recommnd such workers to engage such mediation.]
				[also we had a rock-ass roleplay of a militant worker below.]

		<we are cognating similar to workers who want to fight.  we hold anger, and aim it at groups asserting power that get in the way of our needs.>
			<

				[workers peacemake with town process]
					[militant workers: we need our urgencies to be heard and acted on!]
					[town process: we need our ways of sustaining things to continue!]
						[militant workers also need their ways of sustaining things to continue, or they wouldn't have interrupted town's.]
					
					Mayor: "Militant workers, please speak to the assembled crowd.  We will write down what you say, and talk about it.
					        Afterwards, we hope you can present 1-2 people who can represent your needs at our meetings, if possible.
					        If that is not possible, please return and we can relate again."
					
						Militant worker: Thank you so much for honoring me this way.

= Militant Worker =
I want to foremost say that I have never been listened to before.  My entire life.  What you are doing by gathering people to listen to us, is incredible.
We desperately want to relate around this happening more.

Just like you cannot continue your daily operations when we occupy the town, <begins crying: I'm sorry .... this has never happened bfeore and people have died as a result ...>
Just like you cannot feed your families or raise your children when we force you into the rebellion, we cannot feed our families or raise our children when we are
forced into your town.  The difference is that our people die.  Yours have ways not to die: health insurance, friends and family, police officers who help you.

<suddenly a group of state police come up and attempt to overpower the town meeting.  relations with them are ongoing.>
