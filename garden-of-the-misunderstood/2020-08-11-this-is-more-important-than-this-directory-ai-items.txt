building next steps:
	- smooth out current work (middle-relevencish) so that fewer errors
		- dataflow.
			[bug: flows do not show steps (maybe no steps yet)]
			[still unimplemented: alarm if output unused]
			[bug pending: input flows aren't threaded if we assume the latest flow is the relevent one. ]
			[bug pending: not sure if anybody is outputing a step_context in their from]
				[goal: link output instance to input instance] [link to from objects of inputs.  each input has a different from object.  these should be specified in inputs list in outputs.]
			->[ ] catch unused outputs, helps with flow issues
				after a call, we'd ensure the context has no outputs that are not in the outputs specification
			[function call log idea]

		- for-side: variable wraps rather than mutates
		- for-side: separate step-variables from specification-variables?  for thinking while debugging
		- produce small chunk that runs.  test not passed yet.
		- considering: type-checking.  would reduce errors. (1 identified)
			type-checking can also aid in matching variables when generating habits
		- considering: make-most-habits-text, to comprehend dump output
		- considering: function pointers / class methods over std::function.med-high return.
		- considering: wrapped values in contexts.  for not mutating values to tag them.
		- considering: more clear dump format (1 delay): name looked like key
		- discarded: literal special case.  return too small


	considering focus management, kinda
	let's build a bridge so we can cross the river.  meanwhile ...
		-> bridge to cross river
		-> getting bricks
		-> eating food
		-> communicating with bridge-people
		each one has a life-shape-goal, that relates with the whole ongoing process.
			[a community[basically] that stewards how to use it now, given why it is a good idea]
		okay! bridge-goal-people, over there.  bricks-getting-people, over there.
		eating-food-people, over there.  eating-food, you say that we need to steward karl's personal life better?  so much that we should act on it now if we can ... and you say that there appears to be a general way to do anything that's a good idea?  we are in that way now, right?
				[above process is analogous, direct process defeats it]
				[karl's-life-needs not included in piano-practice-ai.]
		[karl's-life-needs-people, over there.
		 ai-people, over there.
			piano-practice-group
			other-group
				i need you to fight me, to do anything.  [oh]
				[you also appear to be expressing high-priority-emergency,know-how-to-do-this-and-can-do-it-now]
					[so we would have other-group fight karl's-life-needs.]
						[i am so confused.  let's organize this better]
		 write-]
[BLARGH! our decision making processes!]
	[i don't want to fight you.  i'm not as strong as you and you look upset.]
[okay, so that group decided to work on ai right now.  hunger is still retriggering but now it is in decisions.]
	[i want to writhe a bit then.]

review on do-flow-next: debugging this took too long to be considered caused by effective choice.
	do-flow-next needs addition that reduces complexity errors.
			-> variables overlap with nonvariable symbols, could make errors
			^-- maybe this can help.  also considering general what-to-do.

		[once bug found: would flow tracking have resolved these bugs, by complaining if return values are unused?] [for flow tracking: when value is produced, add to pool.  when value is mutated, remove from pool, and add new values, linked to old values.]
[this error is big.  please organize parts to reduce further similar errors, after it is fixed.]
					  ^---- middle relevence

		[also note: error tracking raises dataflow tracking: adding flow tracking
		 to scripting could severely aid script debugging.]

HEY OLD STUFF IS BORING: THIS IS VERY SLOW UP HERE DUE TO LACK OF BUILT PRACTICE.
	try doing right-after-small please
		planning this.
		smallest is start from nothing
		after-with-meaning would mean work off of just-started, or smallest-working
		let's try just using ref class.
	
	[note: contexts can be tracked with the sym::outer attribute]

we are taking slow to not make harm. got a nontranslated expression, negativity associated.
	rep says, piano-practice getting growing-harmed.  time for break.
		hrrrrrm  want to do basic-small.
		accepting break, has grown in the past.




	[am i there?  my plan-to-continue involves massive error spread / distraction handling.]
		[practice smaller parts.]

	distraction: i always want to lubricate my eye.  this is appreciated, supported,
	distraction.
