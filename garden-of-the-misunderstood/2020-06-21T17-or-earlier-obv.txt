okay we have some building request to think about hwo to calculate a 'good' engagement time that doesn't unbalance things but doesn't waste time switching tasks.
is it unbalancing to engage until your ratio is correct?  this will worsen other ratios.
		it oudns like we might want to pick between switching between stuff and not.
		likely when to switch is when your time elapsed not-switching is much greater than the time it takes to switch.
okay what about already-balanced engagements: makes zero
	or case of when all-are-zero: ratio is right?
		divide-by-zero?
		yes quality becmeos NaN when total engagement is zero
