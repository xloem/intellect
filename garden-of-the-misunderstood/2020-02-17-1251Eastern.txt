For the private D4ffodil culture,
Our graveyard stores things in stasis in as precise detail as possible.
All our logs belong in here, unmodified.
Commentary giving more information on the past is highly welcome, and should be kept separate, its source identified,
and also stored in precise detail.

We harvest meaning from these graveyards, compressing them with so much understanding that somebody could be brought back to life
if necessary.  This is never, ever, done.
