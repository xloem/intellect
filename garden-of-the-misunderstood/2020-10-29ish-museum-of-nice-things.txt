museum of nice things
	[also known as normal reality -boss-rep [obv-disg]]

you walk into the museum of nice things

nice things are everywhere
you walk up to a really nice thing, and think of how nice it is

other people are here, and they all look so happy and satisfied
"hello," you say to one of them.
they smile.
"oh, hello.  isn't this place nice?"
you agree.  it's so nice in the museum of nice things.

you walk up the stairs to find some more nice things.
what kinds of things are nice?

are skies nice?
are hugs nice?
are memories nice?
keeping memories is really really nice.
we like keeping memories.

there are some memories in the museum, that never go away.
it's not because the museum is careful with them.
it's because they are so important, that they can't ever go away.

	what makes them different from other memories?

they are made with a special kind of structure, that doesn't lose its detail over time.

	can the owner of them summarize them away when they are ready to pass on?

yes, but often memories stored this well are so highly valued by the community, that
they are still preserved in detail after that happens.

these memories are some particular ones like that, of someone who is no longer alive,
but shared their memories, and everybody thought the memories were so important, that
they were preserved forever, even after their owner decided it was time to move on.

over here, we have a child who can't get hurt, or turn severely irresponsible.

	are they okay?  it sounds like that might hurt a child, to have it happen to.

they are great; nobody has harmed them.  it's not possible to harm them.
the reason they can't get hurt is because they are so endearing.

	[boss thinks, the reason they can't get hurt is because this is normal reality,
	 and so they have a community keeping care of them.  a community that would
	 defend and understand them at the expense of any of the members' lives.]
