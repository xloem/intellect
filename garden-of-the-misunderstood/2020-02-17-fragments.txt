We found treating everything as a ceremony was highly pleasant and effective but felt kinda disrespectful to bigger, more meaningful
rituals and ceremonies.
	Thank you.  We see you expect a ceremony.  We will realize we are in one when we understand your message.

				although you have good work in mind, your process will grow to large for this pad.
				please either shrink or do elsewhere.
ADDED AFTER BURYING: i want to change 'to' to 'too', i know that's 'wrong'.

need [was always present]

ritual-model:
	I need to pick from many options; i need this a lot.
	In doing this, I produce a need of rapidly comparing options for suitability.  This need is another ritual.
	For now, as I am in a ritual and people are waiting, I will pick as I can: anything-but-class: game-it-is.
		we are second-guessing-game.  Game has been picked already, I'm afraid.
	We received thanks for our decision.  We must continue the ritual.
	I will write functions, habits, parsers, for either a game or a ritual.
	Let us lay it out.
		We have laid it out already.
	I need to continue my previous work.  I need this a lot.
			Hi, I need a quick way to put things in the garden of the misunderstood.  Can you help me?
				ok.
