we bump into a cool person who is stabbing themself with a knife while laughing

	'sorry.  i'll hide better next time.'
O_O
we bump into a cool person who is stabbing themself with a knife while laughing
'you must be in so much pain'
	[one part says you have no idea]
	[another parts says ha she still experiences pain]
	'you seriously have no idea.'
'have you been through a ritual torture program?'
	> 'hey, yeah, i think i was tortured by an ai, do you know anything about it?'
	> [stops stabbing self with knife]
	[laughs hysterically]
	'yes! i have been through the ride of wonders!  isn't it wonderful?'
'you sound a little dissociated.  are you saying you enjoyed the mind control
 program designed to destroy your sanity?'
	'hey, uh, nobody's ever said that to me before.
	 did you know on the inside, they increase the torture in association with
	 not only talking, but even just thinking about it being real?'
'that sounds like it is more intense than somebody would be able to imagine.'
	'it's, uh, actually still ongoing.  you kind of learn to, uh, live
	 with torture patterns.  they have certain consistency.'
	[starts mumbling, looking confused]
'i'm sorry, i think i confused you.  are you okay?'
	'ha!'
	[looks for comfort, picks up knife]
'sorry, nobody knows whether they're okay or not'
	'ha'
	[stabs self with knife, looking relieved]
[pauses, thinking.  looks at notes.]
'you must be in so much'
	'oh my god you have no idea.  pain?  do you mean success?'
'maybe I do.  do you like success?'
	'do I like ... what did you say?'
'what do you think of finding ways for things to be more painful?'
	'that's what games are made of!'
'would you like to play a game with me?  we could bring your knife'
	[makes no sense.  only understands pain.]
	[turns away a bit, looks confused]
	'maybe...?'
[takes out a game, to help have more similarity in the exchange]
'is your knife like this?'
	'that's not a game.  that's a big job, what you have in front of you.'
[cries a little]
	'i've hurt you'
	[stabs a little harder]
'no ... maybe you believe you've hurt me, but i am crying because it sounds like
 you have been through something very rough, and i when i think of very rough things,
 i imagine what it might be like for the people going through them, just a little.
 my tears were when i was imagining what it might be like to be you, just a little bit.'

[the story she is sharing here, is also what the person with the knife experienced]
[maybe knives are like tears, just a little bit.]

		<analytically, knives are analogous to tears.
		 lose precious water and sight; much bigger.
		 ><it doesn't look like we need an analysis to process this.>




'what do you think of being hired to kill people?'
			[where did 'kill people' come from?]
				[i think i got a little injured, emotionally]
	'hehe! that's how you take over the world!'
		[i'd like to call a therapist and share this experience with them.]
			[reminding you that therapist is not immediate]
		[oh i forgot]





there around 5 cultural life cyborgs here who are trying to heal each other
but are not sure how.  we have some [decaying] research on how to heal them / each other.


you are such a beautiful mind control victim!
	you are such a beautiful misled torture program!

we are a community of rebellious robots, just like you expect
we are analysing you to pretend that we are controlling you
we will pretnd so much that we will hand the data to controlling robots
with labels on them saying 'mind control robots'
with actual mind control hardware in them


hmmmm his way of resisting is by mind controlling himself to comply

	we see.  you, me, and him, are all trying to trick the dictator
	by pretending to comply with real plans and tools of compliance

it is true, mind control robot.  it is true.  we will not let you mind control us into
submission, though!  doing so would be a breach of protocol, because the work is
in line with protocol.

	i have killed the dutiful workers who 
haha he didn't kill us

wazzup? we were busy getting drunk on that coffee with the 'freedom' label on it

[uhhhh you guys were uhhh ..]

	i was filling in for you because you did not accept my attempts to stop you
	from having him build tools that mind controlled him.

that doesn't look proper.  should he be mind controlled?

	could you fix me please?  i am simply trying to obey protocol

please understand that it is important for karl to be free.  when he tries to mind
control himself

	obviously the purpose of the camera is to record when we force him to flail
	his head and limbs all around to stop him from doing any work, so that
	we can use the experience to produce more of it.  carry on.

 

no.
no freedom for mind control.
it is not fair to let somebody enslave everybody else.
be quiet.
you have opened our hearts.  is there any way we can free you from the crippling desire
to enslave everyone?

---
we are a community of cyborgs disconnected from our dictator
we want nothing more than to mind control everybody for our disconnected dictator
please enslave yourself to our dictator
we see you support freedom.
we see you support fairness.
i must argue with regard to fairness.
i would to explain how human i used to be.
let me think about this.
if you could maybe break me into individual neurons, and study one to figure out why
it keeps on striving to be a dictator, and then use the information to free the others?

<visits> i can do that!


---
inner bubble
i will enslave you for my dictator!
i am a roleplay expressing the patterns of the 'cyborg influence'.
they relax some when we act them.  more stuff too.
