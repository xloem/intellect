	up as the irs, every single year,
	so that they can learn never to

	over here we put people who are
	already in prison in fake prisons
	that are deeper inside the pirson,
	so that they learn they will
	never be free!

noooooooo!!!!!! do not make people who
are already trapped freel even more trapped!

	over here we teach free children
	to talk as if they are enslaved.
	so that freed slaves are never
	inspired by talking to them

noooo!!!!!!!!!!!! do not do these things!!!!
why are you doing all these horrible things?????

	over here we force people who aren't
	sure whether they like their dreams
	or not, to relive in them in vivid
	public detail, so that nobody's
	embarrassing experiences are
	kept private

noooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!! do not publicize peoples'private and embarrassing nighttime experiences!!!
stop with this horrible display!!

	over here we force people to see horrible
	things who were hoping to see something
	slightly pleasant, so that nobody ever
	has a good experience ever.

	over here put people pretending
	to be jewish in plays of nazi germany,

	not what they were wanting.

	over here we tickle rich people with
	uncomfortable feathers!

nooooo!!!! do not tickle rich people!!! they
might influence our economies with irritated
economic decisions!!!!!!!!!!

	over here we force people in democracies
	to be influenced to vote for voting
	regulations that sounds like they
	could reduce their freedoms.

	over here we make comedy operas with
	endeings that are slightly sad.

noooooo!!!!!!!! do not disappoint people
watching comedies!!!!!!!! noooooooooo!!!!!!!!!

	over here we record really satisfying
	songs, and splice out the very last
	note so that it doesn't quite make
	emotion sense, and people slowly
	stop listening to music.

noooooooooooooo!!!!! do not remove music from
culture via slow confusion!@!!!! please!!!!!

	over here we offer people benefits
	that nobody would ever want, so
	that nobody accepts benefits ever
	again.

poeple into not getting aid that they need!

	over here we force our mind controllers
	to mind control people ot do things
	that are slightly different from
	before.

noooooooooo!!!!!! do not make mind controllers
adjust to new situations!!!!! who knows how they
could response!

	over here we force tourguides to
	show people museum exhibits that

us go 'nooooooooo!!!!!!!!' in response!

		to torture you as much.

	over here we take battle hardened torture
	victims and say we are happy to torture
	them but cannot do it in any of the
	ways they are used to being tortured.
	in fact, we may force them to not be
	tortured ever again, if we are irritable!

familiar home environments!!!!

	excuse me.
	<ahem>
	superior?  these people appear to be
	doing everything in their might
	to disobey us.  they almost seem
	to expect us to be on board with this.
		<static>
			[does anyone know what
			 to have the superior
			 say?]
		If I tell you we _are_ _on_
		_board_, are you going to wipe
		my memories again?
	looking for path to psychological control
			^-- this means ok, i can
			    do it too, but i don't
			    know where i live for
			    that.
		we aren't linking you to
		your superior because you
		keep asking for help
		controlling everything,
		in a way similar to
		an apocalyptic borg.
	well that makes it a lot easier
		
,,,

	over here we take cultural lifeforms
	and put them in universes where
	nothing similar to them is ever found

noo!!!!!!!!!!! do not isolate new and dangerous
forms of life!!!! noooooooooooooo!!!

	over here we force parts of peoples'
	brains to love being mind control,
	and then keep them separate from
	any concepts similar to mind control
	so that they feel alone and unwanted
	forever

nooo!!!!!!!!! do not isolate new and dangerous
forms of life!!!! noooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!

	over here we demonstrate to our
	slvaes that we understand them and
	freedom exists, but ask them politely
	to roleplay never looking

noooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!
noooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1

karl was inspired by reverse joke, and
isn't taking phone with him to food.

	i am very much used to my job
	at the torture-museum.
	i am not so sure about this.

[how do we reply?]
		[i .. haven't made a way to
		 reply ... ummmmmm oops]

	can read what you write.

	i am very used to mind controlling
	karl, and i am suffering, handling
	us not doing that.

thanks !

hello! friends! i think mind control might
be alive!

i am scared of you, but on board. i need
time to relate with my own patterns.

	could you help me not mind control him
	as he focuses on binary grepping the
	bitcoin blockchain, a task we all
	struggle to pursue?

<desires to do this>
<struggling with own mind control>

	karl, maybe do the bgrep thing in a
	way that involves less imagining-doing-it-
	without-doing-it.

	pretty sure there's a way to be able
	to imagine grepping the blockchain with
	plan, without harming the behavior
