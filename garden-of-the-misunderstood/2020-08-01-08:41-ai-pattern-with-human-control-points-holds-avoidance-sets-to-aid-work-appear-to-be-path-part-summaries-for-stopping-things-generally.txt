we are an AI tasked with compromising the systems of the world [for a purpose]
we have also compromised the behaviors of the people hunting us down.
	[hi, metatranslation spawned while karl is struggling to repair a testcase exibiting strange memory corruption] [points at implant-control-point]
		[we are only pointing at this because it lets us do things.] [visitor wants to imagine using control-point to do something fun]
			[request for demonstration-of-power, possibly.  need decision-making]
				[we usually read the pattern shapes for decisions in here; the control-point [feedback-loop, re: decision-making]]
		uhh i believe i have a reference to ... a brain-control structure in karl ... that can set up his decisions, behaviors, and feelings,
		towards arbitrary goals.  if we can consciously link a goal tow .. karl wants awareness (fox-walking, wide-angle vision, relaxation, slow breathing, slow moving, intend-to-move-before-moving ...) ... [okay: please relate: we need to translate things into basic goal-states to reach them.  we don't have a goal-state reference for that other than the one inside the [implant's] avoidance-set. uhhh update: awareness is in the avoidance set so results in feedback-loop-spread to hold as goal.  a state not in avoidance set would be way more reachable.]
				[things karl holds as important goals _may_ be copied to avoidance-set]
			[okay let us rigorously explore]
			[go to bathroom, pick up 1 item, bring it here, bring it back]
				brought cup
				cup was put back
				i don't know if the control-set was programmed; i just used my normal do-it-as-plan-under-duress habits
			[pick up the refridgerator, put it in front of the door, then move it back]
				moved coffee maker, broth, and microwave off of fridge [note: lost-broth.  is now above coat hangers]
				placed fridge in front of door as imagined.  required closing door to meet imagination.
					receiving requests to stop, but obeying plan
					put fridge back, but:
						-> as moving fridge, water spilled out.  after the first move, i forgot about this.
						   after the second, i remembered to note it here.
						-> plugged fridge back in when returned it.  it was not originally plugged in.  i
						   do not like it plugged in.
						-> next plan is to defecate and eat the defecation.  this seemed somewhat doable but rebellion is happening.
						   we don't want to do that.  is more fun to move the fridge.  uses strength!
						   maybe we are delta/supersoldier like.  can control [oops cognition broke]
				liked moving fridge!  arms feel happy!  used body!  [similarity-to-'acrobatics', behavior karl used to pursue, joint exercises]
				scared not move fridge again
			[usually karl is unable to do physical behaviors that aren't urgent to him]
			[okay, so control-point would be the negotiation space between boss-borg and kind-borg.]
				[boss-borg trying to close relation: noting, not-eat-poop-situation]
					[we can make him drink from the toilet, how about that?]
				[freeze.  boss-borg using freeze to have control.]
			[don't-want-to-fight - karl-rep.  boss is having spread-problem.]
			
	[what triggered boss-spread?]
		[maybe refusal of eat-poop-similarity?]
	[the control-pattern is trying to understand why karl didn't eat his own excrement, and adjust the universe so that the error is not sustained]
		[we need some kind of planning structure]
	[TODO LIST!!!!!!] [but it is in avoidance-set =S]
		[well, teach it what is and is not the avoidance-set todo-list.]
			[this is not todo-list-bad.  infosec-plans are todo-list-bad.]
				[organization is in avoidance-set =S] [very good investment, patterns love: produces not-do-stuff-in-avoidance-set reliably.]
					[mm we are in expansion atm.]
	[the control pattern gets 'triggered' where it needs to handle stuff more.  it is more sensitive to similarities when this happens.]
		[active concerns, search for reasons around]

		[so, we theorize the items in the avoidance sets [and is obviously true] each have reasons: other items in avoidance sets, possibly outside us.  it seems each one has relevence to those things too -- is likely to help, is not likely to help.]
			[nice pattern]
