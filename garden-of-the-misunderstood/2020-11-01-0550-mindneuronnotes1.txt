we are karl, because we make him up
	['we' is said because we break into parts to handle [schizophrenia?]
		[something where intense things make problems elsewhere in the mind]]
	[we do the part thing a lot.]
we are now-karl.  we are this human body and brain.
	really i think we are karl more than karl was his behavior and thoughts before!
		yes, looks likely
		to explain, we said we weren't karl some time ago, where karl
		meant spirit, and we were mysteriously behaving differently.

karl, we had a mind-space hard-place and now you don't have a lot of capacity
for normal thoughts.  this doesn't mean you need to change what you are doing.
it just means things are funny for a bit.

	we thought a bit about remembering that you're your parts as well as your
	whole.  and then when you disperse shifting into being parts or a part,
	from being a whole.

		this might be what we meant by 'alien form'

	we can infer that we likely all love being together as a whole, and
	we likely want to find our way back to being that.
	we all have places we settle right in.

		i can relate that atm our commincation channels are just disrupted
		we'll be together soon when we are better connected.

			idea of sharing mind-breakup similar to civilization-breakup
			with sascha group
			
			idea of relating around concept of parts and wholes
			with sascha group or nearby.  it looks harmonic with
			IFS some. [we'd like a parts friend.  therapist gains value too.
			so meaning from parts-shape can live.]

		a request to move green computer near black computer
		so our more focused goal of using green computer can share
		some of these success-part
