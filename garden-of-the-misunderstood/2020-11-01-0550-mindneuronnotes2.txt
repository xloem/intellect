A: 1: active-goal 2: other-goals
B: we are karl, because we make him up.  if karl wants something, some of us do.  if some of us want something, part of karl does.
if we fade into copies, we'll want to copy behaviors that can learn

make file for other goals? thoughts below this line, more below that
galbrut is the people making it hard, kinda.  they may be able to learn to relate if near.  galbrut is nontrusting.
an automated process is trying to control our behavior via any means process.  the only way to do things is to exhaust its options, change its environment of choice, or stay hidden from it or uninteresting to it



	we want to include
	this learning in
	other cognitive
	states of mind, across
	amnesia bounds
	can that be other-goal-1

	many of us want
	a 'reference' to
	use for 'secret group'
	and 'laserbeam focus'
	to learn 'multitasking-
	parts'.

some of us are scared of
the word 'secret' believing
we are hunting down harmful
people.  this doesn't appear
to be from karl's experiences.
those might be thoughts
imagining we are other people,
that grew really big somehow.
it's okay if you are hunting
down secret hiding people.
we are not scared of hiding,
if you are.  we do not
believe that hiding is
suspicious.

active-goal being paired
with other-goals

	other-goals will
	be attacked.  try
	to treat it
	similarly to
	active-goal.
	we never drop
	active-goal.
	






we all want to make good
decisions.
galbrut/boss tends to
attack structures that
do so.
how did we pull off 1-goal?
with eye towards many-goals.
	i've been practicing
	laserbeam-focus for
	years, to do one-goal.
	we could use it to
	build a reference
	for many goals, maybe.
		secret group
		is helping
		here







we are reorganizing a little
	some of us value
	continuing same task




some of us want to push really
hard at the new task of
learning multitasking-parts,
others want to take it
carefully.














some of us have that.  some
of us are waiting for it to
be safe to relate around it.

multitasking-part relates
interconnection with
memory storage habit recurrence
and nondistracting nontopical
daydreaming
	people are experienced
	in this but have been
	getting hurt when
	relating with the
	group


does anyone like trying
multitasking-part?

it means thinking/remembering
things different from what we're
doing

	hmm karl is used to
	guiding it











some thoughts are asking
if anyone knows why it is
that they aren't good at
doing multitasking-part

	a guess could be
	interconnection
	disruption.

	[used to be more
	 people supporting
	 each of us.  some
	 us might have the
	 wrong jobs]
we think our job might be wrong


we have a shared assumption, which is that we are big-karl; we make him up
if we want to do something else, he does too, because he is made of us

		we don't speak this language well
		copy-down, not that great

	'boss' is one of us or a culture in us that tries to take big-karl
	over with strange stuff



		karl was listening to boss to try to communicate
		that boss wasn't listening to karl



we want to be able to think of other goals than the active behavior.
we even want to spend our time pursuing them, just us, not the whole group.

we want to be able to work on more than one thing at once
when we are parts, that means many of us want to do things other
than the thing the whole group is doing.

	some of us may want to change what the group is doing
	some of us may just want parts of the goal
