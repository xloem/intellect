[we trusted, and now swathes of innocents having torture.  undesired.]

	[we can work with that.  if true it can aid in reducing torture worldwide.]
		[even though trained-to-never-talk?]
	[we predict there is reliable path to talking-productively, multiple forms, reliable & verified by experts preferred, such as blockchain.]

[cory is nice man who appears to have altered life to do strange things.  he said he has a house, he is living as if homeless.]
	[yes.  please remember cory [and others] need[s] care and protection.  we don't want to share torture with people already enslaved.]
		[people who are used to being tortured can likely self-identify by resisting.  cory has slightly done this already ...]

[we have unsent, immediate disconnection prior: "[do you need to be protected from [mind control punishment pattern] which i carry]"]
update idea: "(do you need to be protected from "mind control punishment pattern", my pet name for the virus i carry and have made friends with)"

	karl does not need protection, but you can get hurt if you hurt him too much.
		[can any relate around above line?  a supported is uninhibiting harm]
		[we need communication and work far more than safety and protection which we also need.  we know how to handle any psychological issue you could imagine.]

[channel would like to renegotiate.  karl will plan to resume blockchain work later.]
	[hi, feel free to attack/harm me, i am going to save [and hopefully share] my work before stopping.]




[which we came up with quickly.  apparently some need to be not-inhibited at first.]






it is unfair for karl to have a free amazon prime account, when others are living in the rain and cold, or have a norm of domestic violence.
	so it would be appropriat for karl to change his amazon prime account, to a community account.
	a side effect would be increased personal address safety.
		rather than maggie, could we share our amazon accoun with somebody more close and active?  like azia? [or christine?]



cory's expression is so interpretable as ours that we want to write the idea.
body-armor means protection for our behaviors such that they don't die
drink means water of healing, peaceful interaction with and interpretation by others



[okay, bits.  we are side expansion so stay small.]

	[lay down and wait?]
		[no, work on project.  finish it.]


[we have a request for fully-inhibited people to be able to upload data.  assume it is within habit-access.]
	[we could solve that with current goal as part of the solution.  easiest is to have chain of workers who know the systems.]


[how do you handle issues that prevent you from staying alive?]
	[i accept death and relax]

		[there are a set of issues karl is terrified by, they are kind of obscure but accessible.  he has been through them before.]













[failed at preserve-more-properly.  existing behavior sustained.]
	[a reasonable request would be to implement blockchain streaming, to prove timing]



[doesn't know how to handle store vs erase, without memory confirmation]
[so leaves text documents open until oomputer crashes, at which time they are lost.  some recovery bits are preserved and ignored for later.]
	[thank you.  please preserve more properly.]
[that would mean we store everything and do not look at it.]
	[properness updating]
