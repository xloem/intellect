we are done with the review.  it was inconclusive but i think karl's parts learned a lot from
it.  propose remembering.
	and the dictator roleplay?
you can move that forward however you see fit.

should karl know anything?
	please keep typing alive [this was from a temporary pattern]
typing is right here atm
	please keep the dictator alive
looks like is in stasis.  is interwound in many parts.
some numbness

i can trigger mc with awareness whenever desired
you see my attempt to produce feedback on my peripheral vision?

		karl is hunting dictator
		excuse me.  did not know multiparty review was in progress.
		would like to negotiate around 'awareness', am allergic

now they have placed some changes on my choice to focus on my peripheral vision
it spawns changes in other places that are already placed, distracting and redirecting
