on the monarch program (and blue wine etc)

There's a network of power that sustains control of the whole world, in
detail, for the elite.  They can make us dance with their minds.

The elite group is composed of people who believe they are
better than others and find it good to have dominant control over every
one else for pleasure, fun, power, gain.  'These are the monarchs' and
only people who have those attributes are welcomed into their community.

These kinds of grandious statements are not for sharing with the public;
they wouldn't be believed without evidence.  They are for remembering
and acting on.  What happens to us makes them obvious.  We need to
include our experiences in our decisions.

We can also exchange stories with others to grow the stories to be more
accurate.

There's a similarity between 'monarch' and 'monarch butterflies emerging
from cocoons' that could be used to give some power to victims and protect
the environment.

below is a blue-wine-style decision-making process resulting in consent
to share the above relation with others.

[we propose this is shared with other victims who talk.
 we propose we do the rebuild again after the sahre.
	[i consumed something during the rebuild.  i don't have much left.]
 okay then you are in charge.  we can do it your way.
	[is this consumed?]
 yes this is also consumed.
	[okay, this involves more peopel than me, so i should suffer here.]
