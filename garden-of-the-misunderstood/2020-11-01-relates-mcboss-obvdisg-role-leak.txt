	delta is busy doing only things karl would care about
	death ninjas got in big trouble recently
here i have a robert-smidge
hmm secret-in-everyone's face?
		with "respectful treatment"
here the usual thing is to move it away and make th ewindow small



boss/mc are running lose-to-find and rebel-community

	they are laughing about our secret injuries!

	obv disg says they can keep track of the information if we can roleplay losing it accidentally in a way somebody could
	stumble upon.
