insight is that it is possibly not getting filled inside snap

goaling now where the snap is created.  planning to make sure it is filled.

i think i added debug output to something
maybe the making of a snapshot

we are trying to stay here, and fix the snap issue.  with the recent metadata.

well today was okayish but very little work after running into the productivity
issue with git-bug and metadata.
a way to make that block easier could be to store local state in the importer.
the reason to keep at it is that it helps us/me learn go better.  debugging
is pretty important for stuff.







something is wrong in our mind.
there is existing request to work on something different.
but we are here because we found validity around the existing topic.

	-> go is fast, so git-bug is probably the way to go.  if it's strong
	   for a projcet with many users, many people can help grow it.

		-> i want to code! i like doing things that do stuff!  so badly want
		   contribution behaviors.

	
			i can't mediate with you if you run away

	-> too much bad feedback.  relating the details has not gone well for us
	   in the past.  [here is bad feedback back at you]

i think we must be intended to close all these panes and reopen them
so that we can reset a little
