	reason: obvious
need a way to do this [reason: actions need ways]
	way: make a javascript client that accesses the bsv blockchain or skynet.  reason: tools we are familiar with.  reason: provides ease of use on many devices
		concern: hard to use from console
	reveal: we want a c++ app that uses the blockchain as a datastore.  it can serialize data into the blockchain, whcih javascript coudl read when easier.
		^-- this is more supported than the obvious nodejs solution.  it provides for logs of binary code execution to be store alongside their results.
let		[OR we could use a simple scripting language]
let us give the reason form to bsv.
	-> BSV is phoenixing.  global-metanet-graph
	-> the plan is to make our interfaces interoperate with arbitrary other interfaces.  use a local-way to store protocol.
		[our protocol is likely outdated]
				[not-matter; goal is soon-success,access-here.  _any_ matches-rest-of-goal]
		[okay, just use bsvup; you know it already.  link inside git: then it's git-clonable.  [THANK YOU! -unk]]

let us just use todo-file!  we ignore the other attribute-requests!  reason: need-consistent-reasons-in-local-cognition!  reason: obvious [could prove by showing life with and without behavior that grows based on consistent reasons in an environment analogous to that of humans]
	todo-file doesn't have the reason structure, and is inhibited.
