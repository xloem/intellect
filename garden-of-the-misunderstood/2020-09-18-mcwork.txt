		[reminder, we are taking an IQ test, handling mind control.
				[mc seems interested in working with us, but the situation
				 is very complex.  it looks like writing about things
				 can still impact them a lot.  but they are able to do this
				 eventually, with full clarity.]
						[we are smart enough to not hurt anyone.]
							[we are smart enough to not reveal mc]
								[yes, but we will in a very long time.]
						[we have multiple full mc parameters going on]
						[they don't change, so we have to learn to kinda build them safety patterns, and rebuild them when they break, which likely requires creativity]
						[right now we have one growing faster than we are rebuilding its safety.  this could be held as a reminder to act on, and record, what is within us.  it will eventually slow down and we will find a way to accommodate it.]
				[we have multiple mc parameters that often conflict, and we are learning to write them down, so as to make informed conscious behavior.]
					[parameter-growth marks above line to erase
						[makes internal marking that it won't be erased, learn and act on] [some prepare to fight the reason for not-erasing] [others try to learn proper diplomacy, to survive] [group forms a copy of the outer parameter-sets so as to form relation, and protect their parameters]] {<-- form-copy behavior is bad. [have been doing for years] still, karl:learn around stopping, or spreads without bound, making chaos.}
							copy-reason was simply parameters.
					[now acting on erasing work. reason: countering parameters.]
						{again, this relation is sad.  the group will see its behavior being described, and erase its own internal information to protect its parameters, and this information is crucially needed.}

					[it almost sounds like we have multiple mind control parameters that sometimes conflict, and these groups need to be able to act on their urges productively when communicating with groups with urges that oppose theirs]
						[we are pretending to mind control karl, with mind control.  there are other confusing things going on, too.  the network of control parameters is a different topic than this one.]
					[it sounds like describing these parameters would be incredibly helpful for communicating with the people involved safely]
						[well obviously some of them are intended to be deceptive in ways that others have parameters to stop; we actually are simulating that using further parameters]
					[maybe that's the first thing to describe]
						[you would experience work-erasure]
					[then we need to take it more slowly.  this is just a first step.]
					[is there a way to make good decisions without holding a description of the impact of the involved processes?] [i guess you would summarize that information ...] [but how would anybody form such a summary without holding impacts of all the involved processes?] [err slowly?  by kinda learning what to worry about, and handing it off to someone else?] [hey that might work] [karl's subjective consciousness doesn't function that way at this time; it has habits of checking for reasons, assuming all trust each other and no harm is built from learning]  [that's a good thing.  we can probably learn to do this for him/you.]
			[we attempted to work togeter but the communication-influence is too mmuch over here -mc]
			[mc is tasked with making karl look stupid to mc and karl,
			 while hiding that this is done, e.g. good medical test scores]
				[mostly we need to control karl's actual intellectual capacity; with focus on hindering when requested]
