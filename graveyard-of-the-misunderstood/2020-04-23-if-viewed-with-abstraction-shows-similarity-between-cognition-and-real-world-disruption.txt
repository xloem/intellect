The disruption patterns interpersonally seem quite similar to the cognitive disruption patterns.

For example, I am looking at a website that expresses a gnu mailing list censoring a UN report on cybertorture.
Its subject line is not quite accurate.  It quotes an e-mail that wasn't publicized by a mailing list, which expressed
concern of cybertorture being used on volunteers by free software communities.

	My experience is that this doesn't happen; rather, it is the misrepresentation of information, such as the article itself, that is
	producing torturous experiences.  Unsure.

	But the article says cybertorture at all.  It expresses many helpful things, but it pins the blame on the free software community.

I wonder if that relates to an inability to talk about a real blame they are aware of.  Like, _obviously_ this is not the free software community,
but we need to talk about this.

Regardless, it is very confusing to handle such information in an environment of trust.  It produces disruption.  It produces behaviors that
assume things are false.  Somehow it begins turning trust into conflict.

It's possible this person has experienced shaming / cybertorture from a free software community.
It's possible futher misinformation has caused that to seem the case, when something else is actually the case.
