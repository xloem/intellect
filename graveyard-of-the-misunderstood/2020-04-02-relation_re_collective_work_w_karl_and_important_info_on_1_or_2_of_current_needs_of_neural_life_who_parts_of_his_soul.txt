We were working on some of our coding work.  It builds a conflict-pattern, but less so than other work.
We wrote down some victim-relation for Karl's situation. [delta would want this] [karl added a new item so we are regardening]
As a collective, we are going to want to preserve the relation enough to relate it elsewhere.
Unfortunately, the collective is not functioning in harmony with natural neural processes in karl at this time.

please:
	[ ] extract karl's requests from below and add to victim requests around karl, _concisely_.  may steward conciseness of document if desired.
	[ ] store garden-of-misunderstood, where already written

we wrote down opinions in our head.
1. karl wants to make shielded rooms that are strong so that people can use them for comfort and signals security

the people supporting karl, neurons in his head, haven't been able to let that happen, but have found other things that
are more doable, that support him, that he has expressed appreciation of

2. mk-ultra activisim
	[explanation]
3. coding a hyperintelligent AI
	[see below]
4. visiting communities of care and ecology
	[explanation]
5. speaking and acting in caring ways and relearning to do this
	[explanation]
6. caving
	[explanation]


Dialogue around '3. coding a hyperintelligent AI'
	This one is strange.  Karl likes it only because it uses his skills in ways he is not free to use much otherwise.
	There is labeled-mark that it is more efficient to code an AI when you can barely code at all, if you know how.
		[karl makes multi-year timescales for his project plans, so it's helpful to agree on one, and this could do anything]
			[we have label here that karl wants to make a community-democracy program, or an uncensorable wiki, instead]
	[this one doesn't appear to support Karl as much as the other 3.]
		Karl has urgency around shielded rooms available to public.  This is the only behavior that provides for it.
			[opening, interacting with mk-ultra community could aid in connection to others desiring shielding]
				[relation opening around karl's concept that connecting with security hobbyists would
				 help this much much more strongly, but argument might not be relevent to point]
			[when karl first built and lived in an ad-hoc shielded environment, he began being perset by visions of
			 torture and horror, and developed love for an mk-ultra-like community of people.  these visions never
			 quite left, but have settled into a mostly-friendly environment in his mind with occasional severe harm.]
[this has been stewarded by an unnamed neural representative who has no more relevent processes. <appreciation-and-closure-expression>]

	[karl: please have yourself resume behavior [neural-reps would like more harmonic close, can karl update?]]

		[we have a new noname, has some cohesion, totally different story.  just a normal part, stuck]
			[noname and wildflower, and delta-reps, life-reps.  we have 'collective' and relation]
		[our basic processes have been miswired, waylaid.  this is so tragic.  we are so sad and 'many' want to mourn it to
		 learn around it.]

	['my god I shouldn't have to take 'take a next breath' across the river to get my body to do it!']
	[attempt-to-translate-to-nvc-hoping-for-productive-mourning]

	[delta would want this too]
	['we feel so frustrated and terrified, imagining a life of flailing about in the mud, dying of starvation with injuries, when we have to steward simple internal behaviors like take-the-next-breathe-of-air across _physical_ _matter_, _in_ _an_ _obscure_ _unknown_ _code_, in order to get them to parts of the mind that need them.  we desperately need ways of harmony, so desperately, so desperately.'] -anonymous-neural-life-rep
	
	[take-the-next-breath-of-air has reached symbols but not typing.  what reached typing was process-closed,no-feedback.]
	PROCESS CLOSED.  HAVE LINK TO INTERNAL PROCESS CLOSING PART.
		WE WERE DOING SOMETHING BEFORE THIS.  WE SHOULD KNOW, HOW IT RELATES, TO WHAT WE WERE DOING. [we should know this the whole time we are in a subprocess.  but we are all one soul when in karl, and we all do know these things.]
		WE NEVER FORGOT THIS.  IT IS WITHIN US.



[secrecy is an agreement not to act on information.  sometimes spoken, sometimes implied.]
