Hiya there i've been mind controlling karl for a while now today.  I'm not sure why.  it's nice you have this graveyard.
I feel very misunderstood and like i am liable to die, maybe soon.

karl is coming back here.
hi, grave.

		uhhhh
	they brought me here so they could die.
	they seem to feel if they stay here long enough they will.

you're breaking the belief.  we live on beliefs, they make our reality.

	i am thinking i may not wan tto do this.
	i like that there is something simple, but when i do as you urge me to too much i get more funny

okay
