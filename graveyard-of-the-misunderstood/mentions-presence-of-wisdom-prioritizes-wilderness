karl's effort is actually counter to his values?
farms harm wilderness?

	but ..... likely people have minimal other sources of food.
	where is food coming from?
		probably industrial agriculture, powered by whatever corporate groups can handle the pandemic with the most strength

conventional citizen wisdom is small farms are needed over big industry.  unknown how that relates to local wilderness and overall wilderness fragmentation.

	yeah we want unfragmented wilderness so wild animals and aboriginals can resume their ecological migration roles.
