we have competing urges atm. <- delta-rep can fix balance, but wnats more-productive behavior.  can make-okay.
	bitfiles: way to close up?
they are general productivity and nonproductivity
	right now karl is midway through rewriting a blockchain tool he wrote
		more-productive than text-game

assuming rationality is nurtured by prioritizing: [which is sometimes false]
1. rationality
2. productivity
	other ideas for priority: health, responsibility, survival

	contextual-assumption assumed-validity validity-check 
	priority, trust
would don't-be-productive like to challenge the validity of this being the best thing to do?

		WE ARE NOT VALID. -don't-be-productive, -assumed-valid <- summary of our-behavior-is-always-valid-as-assumption
		BUT WE MAY NEED A REST [inferred from very distant patterns]
			this is looks like an evolved pattern for [don't-do-complex-behavior], evolved around sustaining the goal,
			not around retaining and sharing its reasons
		INFERRED: karl's-behavior-is-self-labeled-very-long-work.  work unlikely to complete, notably is poor investment
			of cognition.  please stop this work so that a better investment is chosen.
		PROBLEM: behavior not linked to sustain-progress.  we should close up the work so the tool functions afterwards.

boss-group had this pattern, it expands forever as they hold our-behavior-is-valid as inherent:
			boss is doing validity-check on we-are-not-valid.  has: assumed-valid, authorized-to-do-this
			states is best-behavior to change belief thusly: 'we are valid'
okay, this looks invalid to me -robert-rep:
	'we are authorized to harm karl'
		why is it good to harm karl?
		what is 'authorized'?
				authorized means we were placed in your brain by a powerful secret service organization,
				in an attempt to save the world.
		how does it do-good to harm-karl-however-you-choose?
