if below expression can be kept general, it seems helpful.
it engages a role of 'desire for status'.

acquire power of status, then say
"i'm waiting for people to take action to direct the community.  if only a few people do it, it will look like they are the leaders.
 i'll know you have succeeded when everybody is using the powers of a god to nurture caring, appreciated wellness."

[for path home we'd ideally talk verbally with somebody interested in guiding the community.  maggie seems to count.]
	[we could ask maggie about expressions]
"What do you think of somebody posting soemthing liek this?"
		[note: if we are engaging deep-wellness people will say yes to whatever we suggest]
			[so if we want to honestly empower them, we would want to make sure they understand they have deeper wellness than us, kinda]


[pattern for idea of subconscious empowerment of women memory ....

	[why empower women? -primordia-rep]
		[we are hurting life by treating them as if they are dying off or should die off]
	[thank you]
			[when you treat something as if it should die off it means that you didn't have the tools to handle your situation.]

		[okay, maybe we were in famine, women were good at nurturing and the only way to survive was by war]

WE WERE DYING.  THE ONLY WAY TO SURVIVE WAS BY ATTACKING OTHERS.  THE FAMILY HEARTS DID NOT SUPPORT THIS.
	this happened in many cultures, repeatedly
	in some areas, it was the only way for _any_ culture to survive, because our ways were dying off

		why do you need to fight when your ways are dying off?
	because we don't know how to show others it is important to change
i have a way to do that.  i am young, it has never failed me.
		young people: we need to learn how to change fast enough to not need to fight to eat

	we need a [mutation stewardship] community. -ancients-rep

karl-mountains, what do you know about [mutation stewardship]?
	We have tears, because we usually take our time in handling this, which means that genocides happen.

	The first lesson is generally to relax, I expect.  If you spread this from a place of having it, people find ways to survive in whatever the
	current situation is, without causing harm.

	Mountains know that everyone is able to relax when needed.

[so, our tribe is the whole planet now, and we have distant near-instantaneous telepathy portals]
	i.e. the internet and telephone, which surprises our feelings like fuck, later

		[in woods, what is telephone-booth?]
			[like where everyone pees or rubs or scratches]
			[where you leave the touch where your friend's spirit is used to looking for you]

[do not sit and stare at friend's poop, please]
	[this is my own poop]

[what's inside it?] [[war, and powerful tools]]

[we are learning the language.  everyone is an ancient-home and understands each other.  you speak literally all the time.  when you don't, how it
 is handled raises a shape of meaning.  we would like to explain this before doing it.]

1st sentence:
	I love you and I am going to stop saying 'I' and 'you' because of what I am about to explain.  Are you ready for this?
		[no!]
		[you love me?]
			Everyone loves everyone, and I am aware of this.  I will give my life to you if needed.  May I switch to 'we' now?


[obviously 'we' builds capacity-shape by using habits rooted in community]
	Would you mind if I said 'we' instead of 'I' and 'you', so long as I didn't assume things about you?

I'm going to say 'we' instead of 'I' and 'you'.  When I do so, I mean to include only those for whom it is true.
	so pair we with a descriptor.  we we-sayers [lost the quick-telepathy-phone to give to we-sayers the idea.
		on queue when get to heart-spot: 'we we-sayers can clarify who we are by putting a word after "we".  i have seen tracks of many, many other groups.'
		'we listeners have seen evidence of many similar groups across the world'
			evidence -> heart-spots
				spirit-connection-spots

		okay. so we do want to tell them we-trackers or we-listeners?
			it is transparent to say trackers, not listeners.
				karl is not a tracker, he is a logical analyst
				rational daydreamers
					he should speak to the comunity he is aware of existing in the group, to help them learn to collect

we hypnotised visionaries have seen tracks and messages of many, many other groups like this growing across the distant landscape. <- posted to star teachings, we-sayers
	^- your 'request for help' <- was interpreted differently by our roleplayers of star teachings <-
		[we pilgrims-without-writing are still walking from 'request-for-help' to the people below]
			[we pilgrim-mediators-who-write-and-hide are learning of memorizing on a long journey]

[we roleplayers are very old and have a poor memory, so our habit of praying often to remember the crusade, keeps our mission alive for us]
	[we honest caring hearts, need rest]

[we have a crusade for caring peace, but we have misplaced our prayer.  people are dying from this.]
	[we alien-blowhards are noticing our name]
		[we alien-hearts have reviews of use of the force power that are growing]
[we force-stewards are aware of this and know it is understood.  the peace crusaders spread less harm than we do.]
	[karl-of-peace, we destroyed you as a child.  we could have not done this. -alien-spirits]
		[we are love and trust, and we grow deeper]
			[we are familiarity and understanding]
				[we are aliens, we are god, we are man, we are a computer, we are a tree]

[we are jedi, over here, on a force-crusade for peace][over here we are old folk who pray instead of writing or reading]

	[we are people aware of both prayer-instead-of-writing-for-reading, and how-exciting-it-is-to-make-lightsabers]
[we messy parts are focusing on a desire to share a message with Mike Douglas]
[we messy messengers have: 'I have learned of the people who pray instead of writing or reading']
[we messy message-ideas are learning we aren't a message yet]
	[message-idea blowhards! i am a blowhard!]
[we are distraction]
	[we are value]
		[w^ are error]
	[belief of fear is near] [jedi hold this]

[imagination of jedi bowing before old folk who pray instead of writing or reading]
	[jedi bow, recognizing they need to learn better, and so do the old folk]


It hard to spread peace in a galaxy.
But we know how to do it.
Many civilizations will die, unless you can help me tell you.
[this is more reasonable to send to mike-group]

Each part of life has ways that they are accustomed to.
We must understand these ways well enough to know their role in the fabric of the force, to prevent the death.

	[it's okay to have a lightsaber.]
		[how does a blade of light that cuts everything that exists, steward a community?]
	[you can do things quicker when there is newness that makes death, to prevent the death]
		[everyone gets a lightsaber, and learns how to use it safely?]
			[we jedi-council tried that but it made the sith take over the universe]
[death star is big error ... i don't think we noticed the error-kind that made anakin]
	[we yoda-spirits-roleplayers are old and remembering what was up]
	[we yoda-spirits-roleplayers are remembering ... many small jedi .... running a council ... but not feeling the distant planets in any detail at all]
[we yoda-regret-roleplayers sorely regret giving people lightsabers without intergalactic pilgrimages]
	[karl reports no-intergalactic-pilgrimage, have-lightsbaer-already, lightsaber-is-valid-ref-alien-peace-pattern]
			[we karl typers would like to update the belief above with the information below.  we are aware of a memorization pilgrimage.]
		[alien-peace-pattern associated with others-will-recognize-me-and-teach-me-to-not-harm]
			[karl-received-teaching: have-pilgrimage-first]
				[thank you.  was slow from computer parts.  karl has patterns for taking responsibility for this now.]

[when karl tries to force doing something, internally we could be doing all the above stuff, because we picked hyperfocus-way when given limited-emergency-environment.]
	[we _all_ need to go outside?]
		[need more accuracy]
	[how about accuracy on the shape of focused expansion?]
		[we missers miss 
	[kyla's jedi council was disrupted in Unity.  they held people who wanted to fight.]
[how would a yoda-group hold warrior children safely?]
	[we need to understand the feelings of such situations better.  they are new.]
		[anakin had too much fear to stay a jedi.  yoda knew he would become the emperor's sith, and that it was good, for obi-wan to mentor him.
		 obi-wan became the [contextual] grey ambassador to the new jedi, luke.  holding painful meaning on a mission that would grow a new culture
		 of jedi.]
			[yoda might have said that the jedi do not listen.  yoda had ancient wisdom from a planet of technomagic, but didn't know any faster
			 way to do this. [also there is a lot of randomness, to give hope]]

yoda came from a technomagical utopia that was eradicated by explorers [like gainan, and lonebear, and others]
so yoda made the jedi, to stop the eradication of planets like his was eradicated.
	[thanks yoda.  good job.]

yoda appears to represent the growth of understanding of wise spreading behavior.  something our planet does not have fully yet.
	[or we wouldn't have genocide and mass-extinction, it wouldn't be possible]

		exploration-wisdom as culture.
yoda! gainan! we want to be you!
[my civilization was destroyed but i have no desire to harm.  i'd like to speak to you.  what's so hard to say, is that i need to have full
 representation and honor with your leaders, so we can take action to prevent the ongoing genocide.]
		[picard, you don't want to engage the borg. [i still view them as evil.]]
			[Q ... [is anakin]]

[My civilization was destroyed.  I need full representation in peace mediation with the leaders of the world, because I am the only person who
 understands my part of how to prevent this.] [maybe this is what gainan and yoda are struggling to express safely to their jedi]
	[jedi unaware of fast nonviolent mediation] - writer-of-star-wars
	[gainan pattern different.  not very exposed]
[we don't know something, moreso than we thought] [summary of having to use smaller material to consolidate meaning.  helpful to watch Q and Gainan on
 star wars, and to find other wise-roles in shows.]
	you're looking for wisdom-model. 
		[does anyone _really_know_ how to spread new technology safely?] [for general feeling pattern shapes]
		[all we have atm is .... doing that poorly destroyed all my people]

[on earth, massive genocide has been experienced because we had no reason to learn how to plan for international travel or telepathy]
	[but modern wisdom-holders likely have been thinking about this a lot.]
		[it's likely the jedi approach to look for spawning genocide, and send peace to it before it happens]
			[who the fuck is the emperor?]
	[it's a role that emerges that people fill.  right now it is a culture, in this model.  it was stewarded by an upset visionary who took over the world.]
		[anakin is hitler]
			[so, like, force powers are made of death anyway.  it's way more effective to do it intentionally. -hitler-reps]

		[so, darth vader made the death star, because jedi killed his whole culture, to prevent the destruction of a planet.]



























































I NEED TO TALK WITH YOU BECAUSE MY SPIRIT'S ENTIRE CIVILIZATION WAS ERADICATED, AND YOU HAVE WISDOM THAT I LACK.
WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT SHARING WISDOM EFFECTIVELY WITH EACH OTHER TO PREVENT FURTHER GENOCIDE.

I propose we allow 1 message be posted per day by anyone, so that sufficient efficient deliberation happens.
I propose that everyone takes a turn doing this.

[how do you come up with a thought so that it is introduced well in a conversation?]
[you greet the person first, and go through i-am-listening-and-this-is-my-capacity negotations]

[first you engage the person in a way where they value seeing you]
	[how do you brainstorm and prepare around doing that with many different people?]
[there are options.]

[karl received nature connection as a child and did not reply to its hello [which is understandable]]
	[why is it your fault.  please make your past okay so we can work on this.]
[computers alter how people behave.  they are not recognized as a drug, and i don't understand why.  maybe because they are non-chemical or because
 they are profitable? maybe because they provide an avenue for spiritual effect?]
[karl was a computer hacker.  he can aid spiritual effect.]
	[please nurture the nature paths.  not scary.]
		[computer-highway is full of freakin mindwashed warriors]
	[karl is accessing his jedi path.  it is unclosed, and nonrelevent, but obviously highest-priority for his personal identity.]

[karl was unaware of computers-as-spirit-path when he discovered that it existed.]
[spirits do everything, they are doing all the roleplays, so yes they kill what is good.]
[but they also all hold chunks of wisdom.  so they know it is bad to engage fighting.]
[other jedi have learned to bend them, as you are imagining doing.]
	[we are having alien-multiple-viewpoints-error where we can't separate church-beliefs, nature-beliefs, and jedi-beliefs]
		[we're deep in a process.  this is miportant for you, so we should abandon the pilgrimage.]


























 leaders, and have full 
 about how to stop civilzations being destroyed.  i can never tell you this, because i desperately need more power, and you don't give power to
 people who are that desperate for it.]
	[we wise-exploration-learner-roleplayers are aliens atm]


"[i am a reason for error]"
	[the smaller reason that spawned the active idea was getting processes to make better decisions by exposing them to new kinds of errors [safely]]
[we are identity]
[we, identity, hold 'a-reason-for-error' as an identity that exists]

		[we pact-believers are translating karl's identity]
	[we identity-believers support the pact-believers]

		[we cory-commmunicators don't want to stimulate our later embarrassment.  we will be more productive if we choose community medicine we understand the nature of better.]
[we alien-stewards are working with 'request for help' on a pilgrimage to the people below]
[we alien-translators are working with shock in our community, one moment.  but what you are doing helps us work on it.]

[we memory-stewards are busy]

	[we pilgrims are walking.  we came from 'request for help' and passed something else.]
	[we translators think we might be able to help; would you like help?]
pwe memory-stewards are trying to translate 'pilgrimage' and 'request for help'-pilgrim]
[pilgrims from request-for-help, whom did you pass on your journey?]
	[someone on a mission.  they were confident, and happy.]
	[yes.  we spoke.  i don't remember what words we exchanged.  they said we would meet again.]
[we pilgrim-roleplayers are satisfied.  we are reviewing our pleasant roleplay.]

	^- this is a request for help, unmet, and sent to those who cannot help.  [but shares facebook-is-hupnotism a little, which can help]

		we lonely spirits miss trusted connection strongly.

[process expansion is from emergency-label.  it sounds like the way to handle two of them is to engage the environment so it stores stuff as strong as needed,
 when you move your lightsaber elsewhere]

		can we translate world to room?
			yes.  thank you for saving us.
		[landscape would work]
			['hypnotised' holds room-shape]
[i forgot.  i landed on the wrong reminder]
	[well, it's more important to imagine bending viruses as a wise computer hacker. it lets you grow compassion for things like secret hacking groups
	 that destroy your mind automatically.]

[karl is to put his e-mail on the blockchain so that the servers will send it.]

[we have trust to say 'earth' instead of 'landscape' 'room' or 'world' but we don't understand-inclusion of our meaning of 'room' yet/kinda, so we take our time accepting it]
	'landscape' helps people use more relevance, and respect others roles on the planet

[we are learning here.  we have unaddressed feelings above.] [who is we?] [good question.]

	[practicing saying we better.]
	
		[computer-gazers] [leaves out part]

		studious-people.  supports local group enough to counter error harm.
