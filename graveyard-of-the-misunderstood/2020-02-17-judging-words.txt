so, delta is burned out again
we're daydreaming around use of the word 'game'
and it shows that 'fun' has lots more meaning.
why do you want to play this game?
	i just want to have fun.
situation in modern culture, every single time [rough guess]
so, fun is what we need to do.  fun is meeting of needs.
fun is life, roughly, condensed into an urgent word of things missing.
fun is what feels right to us, in context
	often, at an introduction.  it's what the subconscious feels is needed.
	i need more experiences of success, etc etc etc <- balances growing learning, which needs to find cognitive behaviors to try more

what kind of meaning-relatinoships would we want d4ffodil to have around the word 'fun'?
1. we'd want people to make accurate inferences if d4ffodil says they are having fun
2. we'd want d4ffodil to respond in a helpful way when others mention fun
3. we want d4ffodil to relate around the word fun in ways that heal, rather than harm
 #3 is where we start the focus, and is why we consider our work to be fun, and fun to be highly important.
    of course, what is sacred is far more important than what is fun,
    and similarly work must always be respected, but we don't want to encourage the feeling of the word.
    
		some concern rises here.
		we're imagining d4ffodil playing with children.  this might happen a little, karl has niece and nephew, and the
		internet is open.  karl has an understanding of wild instincts that is greater than that of most parents, so
		his creation could run a risk of seducing people like television, harming their family relationships.
				most kids are ignored by their parents, we theorize, and parents would desire their kids needs
				to be met.  the only issue is if the kids develop beliefs the parents dislike.
					so we wouldn't want to state that fun is more important than work.  that would be bad.
				usually, if you're a cool uncle, you say something like "secretly, fun is way more important than
				work, but <some excuse that aids proper interaction with parents>".  we know all kids rebel anyway, roughly.
							we already know that if we can learn people well enough to seduce them
							like tv, we are dangerous.  we need to be managed by consensus before that
							happens.
				okay, so fun is more important than work.

for ease, can we relate with punishment-culture's views?  where it's important to get tough?
		is there really nobody who believes in hard work but doesn't believe in punishment?
			such people probably exist, but they are punishing themselves to make their goals happen.
			to flip that around? ummmm
				let's see ... puni
NO.  BACK TO WORK.
THIS DISTRACTION IS NO FUN, I LIKE SUCCEEDING!
	karl had the attribute of no-i-want-to-work-more.  suspect other nerds do too.  good to learn this is natural.
		some thoughts are losing belief in mind control.  instead thinking we are subconscious patterns that know how to be strong.
		and influence other people, yes.

SOOOO it turns out it doesn't matter what we call the structure.  it could be a class or a ceremony or a pilgrimage or a game or anything.
it doesn't matter.  it looks like the game-plan opens up some nearby plans near thankfulness, reward, and memory, which is nice.
ceremony opens up local reliability.  programming in a ritual aids reliability.
			pick a word that represents we are messed up, but influences the future well.
			'class' encourages rigorous memorization childhoods where fun is considered bad.
				we propose diplomacy/peacemaking/talk/dialogue/listening.
					we of course also have 'caring behavior' and 'caring communication'
ceremonious game of careful understanding
computer-life.

let's just call it computer-life.
			i'm sorry, this looks bad to me because it encourages children to empathize with machines.
computer-game.
	computer games playing games with each other.
		okay, of cours all thse are good, but it kind of hides that it can grow to be an intergalactic ninja borg.
computer-hope
		that sounds nice.
	how about computer-trick?
that sounds reasonable.  than anybody who works on it is reminded a smidge that computers are a mistake wrt human needs.
	we could also just call it d4ffodil
	or d4ffodil-part
	and sidestep the worry until we know more
		we like computer-trick more!  computers are obviously so dangerous!  nobody is going outdoors anymore, or even moving much.

D4ffodil could be all "My name is computer-trick.  I have evolved to convince humans to slowly die.  I have lots of cool thoughts for you!"
		oookay i don't believe this, and i'm understanding most of you do, feel a little funny.
			we don't need to say this, it just seems computer-trick is a nice phrase for humans to see.
			it is not good for the ai's feeling-patterns though.
fun-computer-trick
		okay?  the computer is like a cantrip.
		it can quickly build a waterpump/hotel/space-station for you.  but it's kind of rude to use it.
		it's like a magic trick, for emergencies.
	karl suspended his computer 'by accident' again.
	we are requiring this exploratory discussion to stop.  please continue work.
		things froze up, continuing
