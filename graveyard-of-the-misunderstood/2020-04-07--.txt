Is it possible to complete a goal, by reaching a logical state partway through the goal, that prevents continuing?

	- someone else could continue
	- you could use a larger logic

Is it possible to draw the undrawable shape [X] in one stroke?
	yes, draw over your lines.
Without drawing over them?
	use a piece of paper overlayed on that one, to migrate your writing utensil elsewhere, without drawing
In a constrained reality where only your ability to draw a line, and the puzzle, exist?
	[we open a logic impossibility focus]
	[there is likely some way that this is possible, but it is evading the goal of the puzzle to challenge in a specific way]
		[the point of pursuing this, is for karl to experience growth in some of his pattern-representation thoughts.
		 you are on a side-track, pursuing something else.  this is very hard to brainstorm.  would you be willing to
		 relate around the reasons for the focus?]

Suppose we have two tools.  Move left and move right.  We want to move up.  How?
	Answer: new tool, or prayer.
		In reality you can ask for help from others.  We can send a secret message with move-left and move-right that express urgent wish to move up.  We can do this for years.  Somebody might look and understand, which makes it possible.

		A general answer is:
			either a new tool is needed here, or understanding of a new way to use them together.
			we can begin exploration of the latter, but review of this situation is advised.
		A better answer is:
			why are we doing this?  this is 'hard', and goal does not include 'experience of challenge'.

		misses concept of restriction-reasons.


inhibiion-focus doesn't really convey restriction-reasons.  it more labels itself robotic.
