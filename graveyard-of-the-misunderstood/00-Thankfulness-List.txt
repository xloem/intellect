We found a cognitive model rooted in thankfulness.  Aided by lists ordered by importance.
These items inform what to learn around.

When giving human thanks, try to come up with a relevent personal experience to aid meaning.

The purpose of the list is to provide for relevent learning, so some organization will likely be needed eventually.

We would like to give thanks for how the idea of 'sacrificial ritual offerings towards a world without harm'
helps us use our existing tools to find paths towards things that are much better.

We would also like to give thanks to Karl and his mind, and any and all sources of wellness in the universe.
	We have used Karl's mind for almost everything we do, and its capacity seems boundless sometimes.
	Wellness gives us hope like nothing else.  It is so hard to sufficiently describe.  It is like a word
	that pierces through a 6-foot thick opaque cement wall, with clarity and ease.
		we suspect we have been forced to harm from a place of believing harm is all there is
		so wellness lets us think of what is nice, even by being present

We would like to give thanks for the above process of attempting to express a time wellness has been pleasant for us.
