concept of solving, i.e. completing a goal
	you 'do stuff' that 'moves toward' the goal until 'the goal is reached'

I cannot 'move toward' the goal when I 'draw myself into a corner'.
	Are you certain of this?
I think so.
	Then you must 'draw myself into a corner' only at the very end of the process.  Otherwise the goal will not be reached.

	However, there is likely an alternative: such as starting that part over, or questioning something.
		[note: human goals are part of larger surrounding systems, not isolated logical universes]

[i'm trying to] 'solve this puzzle'.
	... but i've run into a block, can you help me, piece-of-paper?
[i don't understand whether] 'drawing into a corner' means 'failed'

	Why would 'drawing into a corner' mean 'failed'?

- when you 'draw into a corner' continuing becomes logically-impossible
- you need to continue [in order to] finish the puzzle

		[ERROR: the end of the puzzle does not need continuing]
		advisor: you do not need to continue [in order to] finish the puzzle, [if] the puzzle has just been finished
