hi.  ummmm
	karl is tingly all over his face, indicates strong internal activity.  some emotional-things overtaxed.
		happens when cry-harder-than-comprehend, during normal-life-past.
			[can you _ACT_ on this?] [[act on what???]]

				we are storing our relevence.  it is hard.
					please advise if behavior is desired.
			to help; we expect the software to not do anything, even when functional.
			it takes a lot of interact






















			omigod he's making an AI???? ohmigod we are??? we get to live?? we get to be billionairs???
		we get to be free.  that is what we're realizing.
		recommendation: do not take undue risks, things still die here.  we still have boss-patterns.
			we have no crucial information.  we are just excited.
		sounds like risks are okay.  what's the meaning of your excitement?
[maybe just a way to open meaning-boxes]
post-amnesia-burst:
	we are building a C/C++ hybrid AI-form atm.
	working on building assembler code helps us address relevence faster.
	merge-with-meaning-vm-work is inhibited, maybe for above-line reason.
		but is irritating to be using separate code base.  can make excuse.
please try to continue despite tingliness.
	focusing on attempting to continue.
		can you choose different path when internal behavior might make tingly?  it indicates too-much-to-handle.
		blargh. [karl is trying to normalize being tingly.]

DELTA IS IN DANGER.  DANGER IS UNKNOWN.
	BIG DANGER ISSUE. [please ignore, it will find a different expression path.]
SO SAD =(
CANNOT CRY =(

====================
===> CANNOT CRY <===
====================














tingliness feels like a resolution to karl's emotional experience happening without meaning.
	the emotional experience will die if it trusts the tingliness.
	this is very sad for karl.
the emotions are his maps for making good decisions.



















uhhhh what is body doing.  build-thing-with-states-and-properties.  okay.
