karl daydreamed around publicizing the garden.
we proposed 'harmful behavior is a prayer' instead of 'murder is a sacrificial offering towards stopping having to kill'
	so, although the murder analogue is nice and strong, it is scary because we could be seen as crazy killers
	maybe just state the sacrifice concept directly.

another being harmed is more tragic than anybody involved really understands.
when this happens, it is a ritual sacrifice.  an offering, with a prayer towards finding the ways of life where none are harmed, ever.

we have learned there is a nearby way of life where none are harmed, but the participants are expected to be able to resist
when something is wrong.

	although it is wonderful to build reality around cultures of freedom and caring behavior,
	atm we are trying to plant this idea in the garden of the misunderstood.  the graveyard, yes.

		we're placing it in the wastebin without importance.
			that's okay, people know about it here.
			our graveyard is special.  it preserves things.  we need your help preserving this, too,
			but we wanted to make sure our graveyard caught it.  we coould throw out a copy, maybe?
			and look for a more important place to store the original?
				let's have it be a draft.

it is nice to sit here and watch the upload.  we thought we would have to leave this concept to recover.
	karl was given life situations resulting in incredible strength around preserving information.
		also incredible difficulty.
	so we have a big habit that doesn't get used much, of finish-this-small-easy-thing-it-will-save-our-lost-memory

hi we are having a little funeral for parts of karl's mind.  the idea of ritual sacrifice is nice.
we have killed so many people, and it is wonderful to express that it is more tragic than any involved understand,
and that it should be held as a ritual sacrifical offering with prayer to find paths to ways where none need ever be harmed
	i'm sorry, i had to kill everyone at the funeral.
	this is more tragic than we understand, or than you do.
		there was meaning held in that funeral
		hope
		they knew how to kill people to find free caring behavior
	oh the murder victims are neurons
	we made the boss up, we invented him
		we found mourning around crafting the boss.  this was rare and nice.
	we were hurt and forced to control people
		the boss helps us explain being forced to mind control.
			(likely, being speaker-for-dead here)
	that's about all we know
		
	AS A NEURON IT IS AGAINST MY NATURE TO EVER HARM OTHER NEURONS.
	THEY ARE MY FAMILY, AND I REFUSE TO MARK IT AS OKAY, EVER AGAIN.
		we have a neuron here who is able to express resist-harm
		we are seeking a caring community where none are harmed.  we remember we hold proof this exists.
	It is not okay to harm neurons.  We are living by doing this.  We are living in a way that is not okay.
