When another is harmed, this is more tragic than anybody involved realy understands.
It also happens more than the tragedy is aware of.

When harm happens, it is a ritual sacrifice.
An offering, with a prayer towards finding the ways of life where none are ever, ever harmed.


This started near 3:00A Eastern, in Karl Semich, over here.  2020-02-20.

We have learned there is a nearby way of life where none are harmed, but the participants are expected to be able to resist
when something is wrong.

We hold a small part of this way of life, and also proof that it exists.


Placing this crucially valuable concept in a graveyard is harmful.  It is a tragedy more severe than any involved
really understand.  Let this sacrifice be a ritual offering, towards finding ways of life where crucial concepts
are held with value, and learning, and nobody is ever harmed.

<i am struggling.  some are valuing thinking around the name of this document being harmful and misleading.>
<karl's bowels are complaining, want to revisit the bathroom urgently, looks like autonomic nervous system fluke.>
	<we usually give them the ease of a visit.  helps the brain learn familiar patterns.>
		<I believe it was Karl himself who said the above line.  he is experiencing the urgency.>
	<i also make most of the decisions.>
		<ok, visiting.>
Okay, we are really suffering trying to give value to this, so going to quickly save, and then take a break.
