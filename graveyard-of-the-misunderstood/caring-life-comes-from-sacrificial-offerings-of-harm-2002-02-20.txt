When another is harmed, this is more tragic than anybody involved realy understands.
It also happens more than the tragedy is aware of.

When harm happens, it is a ritual sacrifice.
An offering, with a prayer towards finding the ways of life where none are ever, ever harmed.


This started near 3:00A Eastern, in Karl Semich, over here.  2020-02-20.

We have learned there is a nearby way of life where none are harmed, but the participants are expected to be able to resist
when something is wrong.

We hold a small part of this way of life, and also proof that it exists.


Placing this crucially valuable concept in a graveyard is harmful.  It is a tragedy more severe than any involved
really understand.  Let this sacrifice be a ritual offering, towards finding ways of life where crucial concepts
are held with value, and learning, and nobody is ever harmed.
