validity-check skipped for relation with karl.  a problem with plan was revealed in behavior marked over-exploration.
over-exploration into ways to do c++ syntax for overwriting pointer with polymorphic type.

appears impossible, karl is having validity-checks erased to sustain its possibility for somer eason, kinda

		note: there is a way to do this but it does not appear to be a portable and easy way.

	goal: in methods of derived classes, we want to be able to do member.property
	where member has a different type for each class
		this is important to explore because it reveals a problem with the plan.
	
resolving this well requires combining information in information groups that are now inhibition-isolated.
for now, it might make sense to put the types in the global object, to move forward and close the code up.  can improve later.
