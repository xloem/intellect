=> adjusting a metric based on feedback
=> deciding what parts of a context to use for learning

=> number puzzles: learning around what things to try together. specialization: math

it kind of looks like reference is whereness in space of 'stuff'
	high-amount: concept

there might be a better concept, unknown
	maybe leave reference unexpanded and describe its parts, uses, similarities, etc

so, when we're learning a context, we are deciding what references belong in a group
we can then learn around that group, based on an event.

	karl is discouraging thought on behavior
	we are noting that all internal changes are behaviors.
	behavior is important, but it is roughly the same as an event
	how about a choice?

		uhhh when we are learning a context
		we will pop things in and out, or include them different amounts
		the choice to try a particular context is a behavior

			all behaviors are ways to learn

what is learning?
	[answer only partially active]

we're considering a decision being a selection of a group of things among a larger group, in a context
	learning is an intentional 

		[some of our regrowth is 'out of bounds' again]

	[we were thinking of learning relevant context by generalizing decision-making]
