Armadillo provides vectorization and syntax sugar for matrix operations in C++.

using namespace arma;

CASTING
conv_to<Mat<type>>::from(Mat<othertype>); // specify Mat, Col, or Row specifically to work around missing implementations of fixed types

SWIZZLING, LAMBDAS
	for_each // return value discarded, but can mutate argument
	transform // argument replaced with return value
	each_col
	each_row
	each_slice
		either take a reference with a lambda to each thing, can mutate it,
		or return a special object that applies math to every copy of the given thing.

Armadillo structures are indexed tightest-block-first.  So mapped display without dimension-swizzling comes across as (color, y, x) as (row, col, slice)[UNSURE]
