// maybe too-small
// 	// it's nice to have your feedback that i'm too deep in process, but i don't see a reference to an outer process
// 		// okay.  thanks for relation <3 please escape.

// we are escaping, we do this a lot, guards are on-board
// 	the plan will be to clean up a little and make lentil soup.  changing clothes is an option too.
// 		[we can purchase plugs for vehicle in downtime]
// 		[organizing-to-go sounds nice, but takes another escape; hopefully a smaller one]
// 	there is request for other-task, we'll be ignoring that request
// 			[note: we have a drive to return we have not returned]
// 			[note: want to purchase plugs for vehicle]
// 		we would like to organize things to prepare to leave.  could you move me into the other document? [doesn't-work]
// 			[DISTRACTING PROCESS STOLE TIME, ASKED TO BE SHRUNK]

// LET'S MAKE A MEAL, also clean up a little.

// organizing-to-go wants to escape instead of make-meal
// 				^-- organizing-to-go: your shapes are weak and we built around a different goal
// 	we weren't prepared for this relation.  do you see this opportunity is not available?  we don't have a decision-making pro

// let's do this without-promise.  is harder without behavior list.

// 1. reject remnants of distracting process and build habit to repeat rejection as it possibly rerises
// 2. gather messy objects: peanuts-container, blueberry-container, prepared-food-container
// 	this preparation was interrupted.  it was the first one to be typed.  recommend not typing, or prepping for typing by rejecting interruptions.
// 3. grab water and phone
// 4. go to truck.  if not-easy to find trashbag, place trash on floor of truck.  otherwise place in trash-bag.
// 5. begin process of make-meal using truck-pot.
