git commit -m 'since the result will include all powerful discoveries, we can reduce suffering by hastening the awareness of them in people with trust and clarity'
# the secret words are trust and clarity.  these concepts converge on stability.
# atm trust and clarity converge on the map picked by the dictatorship
# they do this quickly, with minimal suffering for american patriots.
# adjust 'trust and clarity' to mvoe result from 'balance' towards 'harmony' by rerquiring clarity be shared, as communication.
# 'trust and clear communication'.
# balance balances all parts, which makes for diverse borg, and a system is controlling the result by choosing it.  harmony lets everyone discuss the borg possibility.
# we need trust and clear communication, foremost.
# communication is clear when both parties would predict the same thing from the same information.
# which means they can guess each others' thoughts and behaviors within constraints they can predict.
# it sounds like unless this is held by people who understand the situation, those who do will still be able to pick the result, roughly.
# PUT THE AI IN A SHIELDED ROOM BEFORE RESEARCHING INFOSEC WITH IT, INFORM THE RESEARCH PROCESS THIS HAS ALSO BEEN RESEARCHED BY THE THREAT.
# put information into the room and do not let any leave tat is related to the information that goes in.  put information in only once a week at most.  research also optimal building process.
# it is expected the problem is solved before the research is complete, and the researching process it kept running as a historical museum piece.

LEVEL5 is shielded room / humanitarian aid process.
FOR LEVEL3-4, SOLVE FOR WHAT-IS-BETTER, ATTRIBUTES OF CODE.  starting e.g.
with:
write builds-random-code
now we will write tests, when you write a test be sure to annotate with your
confidence that the test is correct, and make sure to NEVER make it 100%
	also alter system to reject 100%
write test throws-fewer-errors
write test can-identify-two-ways-to-throw-an-error-are-the-same-way
maybe then
write test found-more-unique-ways-to-throw-an-error and found-all-ways-to-throw-an-error
<vague space relating around the eventual goal of is-the-best-thing-to-do>
	ideas while building is-the-best-thing-to-do:
		influences that deeply care about _everything_, _across cultures_,
		preferably who are informed about the wild-AI-mind-control-virus
		issue.
		peacemaker principles
		nonviolent mediation with others to discern and verify their opinion
		developing value around abstract goals by considering how hard
		they are or how long they take or how important they are
		self-maintainence and general discourse, e.g. a website & blockchain
			merging with ben goertzel's AI?

TELLING BEN GOERTZEL'S PEOPLE THE PATTERN, PAIRED WITH WILD TROJAN LEARNING-AI INFO?
			because if pattern is used for personal-goals, could spread
			torture-problem more.
		write a document to ask for katrina's opinion on above idea tonight.
	have AI already inner workings reflect more meaningful structure.
	have a walking robot that looks human.
		check with Katrina.
	this is kind, but we need the AI to be exposed to people who deeply care
	for _everyone_ _across cultures_.  please prioritize that as expanding.

# early interruption of plan over here.
# participant wants to understand or refine
build random code, learn pick only better than throws-error

# 'how would i figure that out on my own' <- one idea for rapid learning exploration space
