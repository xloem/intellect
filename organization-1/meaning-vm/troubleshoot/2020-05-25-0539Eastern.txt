	let's try to fix conceptunnote so the tests at least run.

	1. concept should be deleted using notepad ownership
	2. we copied everything in, right? so concept won't be referenced outside if it's copied in?
			-> conceptnote makes new concept.  no copying in there.
			-> newnotepad copies changeable concepts in, first with noteconcept({}, newnotes).replace(changeable), then adds a changeable link in imagination

			-> concepts are copied in with imagineset I believe
