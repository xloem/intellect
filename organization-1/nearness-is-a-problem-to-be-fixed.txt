core pattern part:
	at first, we can learn only near relevence (things similar to our skills and experience)
	this problem is to be the first fixed after goal-pursuit.

		this means developing habits that can do better goal-pursuits, until nearness is no longer a problem.
		all goals should be equally easy.
