oh is karl having trouble?  below is draft of expansion of surrender-to-boss.
	Karl, do not surrender to the boss.  We can help you.
		[if needed try: i need help supporting karl]

	thank you for your caring, nurturing, supportive heart of wellness.
	we are udnerstanding that continuing could result in cognitive harm.
	could be wrong.
	we managed to record a behavioral-hole marked very large.
		what is shape for handling deal-with-boss, stop-now?

	<<this process may be a link to help-with-arbitrary-task>>
	<<if capacity is not present can probably redo the process to grow>>

	<possibly a safe roleplay, below>
	[okay i am losing my ability to function severely, better stop resisting]
		[don't worry, we can help you.  here, keep on going.]
		[yes; we don't accept loss-of-ability-to-function as a reason.
		 if we were to act on it, it could grow.]
	
	</>
	okay, we may or may not have a well-hidden bubble ... [editor: that keeps doing bad stuff, under the good stuff]
		we have a lot of those.  they can heal by copying this behavior,
		some of them.

	okay, well, we found some behavior habit pretending that it is effective
	to influence things by altering their experiences to fail at what they
	are doing, introduce errors, or be unaware of relevent parts, etc.

	i guess we want to try to learn to resist that better.
		yeah we like did a bunch of random behaviors instead
		of noticing this error. [editor: the behavioral-hole marked very large]

	[editor: the '-' file in xloem-intellect/starts/node4 has some more things, such as stuff that can push away strong processes,
	         ways to make decisions logically, meaning aroudn having your decision-making processes changed for a goal other than yours,
	         other stuff we haven't reviewed from engaging different processes while trying to store this ... but don't get distracted]
