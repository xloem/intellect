MAPS: delayed, organizing

SELF PROCESS: no-plan-yet
	with maps we can likely make a very simple vm by including next-instruction
	in local-variables

PARSING: ...

WAYNESS CONTEXTUALITY: can be implemented by checking context using reference::kind-get

SETS: using kind types, ignoring values.  more direct solution could be integrated straight into reference.  member functions for this non-present.

ASSERTION-NOT-LINKED-TO-OBJECT: no-plan-yet
	but may be possible using shadow/mirror objects if not implemented,
	which sound simple to use and a little confusing to implement
		we may want to plan for shadow/mirror objects more:
		design for them could change structure
