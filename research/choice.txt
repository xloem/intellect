This monologue is an exploration of how decisions can be made in a way that learns with understanding, communication, and
similarity to the experienced human mind.

The proposal is for habits to produce associated concepts with things, for example how long they take, or what they result in.
Some habits require choice, and need to use this information to make it.

Propose we develop habits that combine the associated information in different ways, to see if these combinations are
useful for choice.
As an experiment, was going to try to some possible metrics, such as how long something takes, and see how this compares
with personal judgement-making.
	when coding we worry about maintainability, difficulty, speed, effectiveness.
	a general decision-making process may multiply value/importance by effectiveness and pick the greatest.

# worry: this research may not close.  it could inhibit associated things.
# reason to continue is because it may inform other decisions.
# do you know it won't close? any concept around how much?
# no.  let's see if it closes.
# wait: experience has danger-label.  many things similar to this have resulted in amnesia and confusion.
# okay.  let's take a break and try to return.  if returning is blocked and not spreading, do other relevent task.
# if returning is blocked and spreading, record failure and research idea for future similar situations.
	
here is monologue:
do not bus to food.  close out code, save research, and then eat.  continue research while eating.
		research informs all other project choices.  do first if available unless other is needed for task.

simplest solution is to do first item differently.

for_each can handle this, or we can do it outside foreach
note, argnametoklist is one passed list in parentheses, so we'd need macros to extract the first and remainder from a list
seems nice and generic, except the remainder will be unsude if empty, which is a little harder.
let's add first item to argnametoklist

		so we have a process in our mind that uses experienced relevence
		to be informed by the emotional intensity / experience frequency / attributes of the different things considered
		and use them to make decisions based on context.
		it's comparing difficulty, speed, generality
			generality seem summarized into kinda maintainability or cleanness
		maintainability, difficulty, and speed.
		as these are influenced, our choices change.
			received a concern around effectiveness and use of time.  is _not_ being summarized as these others are.
		but anyway ... the habits or others associated with them report metrics or summaries that could be of interest
		in decision-making or informed change.
		decision-making processes combine these metrics or summaries using experienced judgement habits
			so, we're spending seconds on a task we did not plan to
			the task has value: this value is just a feeling for me atm, but is related to plans
			the other task had expectations.  this time spent is disrupting their expectations.
		the piece we're missing is combining the useful labels coming from processes
		to make choices they need to function well
		so when i pick what to do next, i need information to make this choice.
		i'll need to try different ways of combining the available information to see what works
		and when i find a way of combining that does work, it could be an important judgement metric that i should
		remember and give a name to.
			say we have number of seconds
		update: we are working on an unstable coding issue.  please make work stable, save, then continue this research.
			research appears to be into how to learn as a human has evolved to.
			makes goal-pursuit better.

it helps us do this to keep parts of the state of mind of doing it.  we started naming parts but ran into some inhibition.
	this is so hard to do sometimes, IT IS AWESOME TO BUIlD TRIGGER HABITS!!! IT IS AWESOME TO BUILD TRIGGER HABITS.
	oh man those trigger habits are so awesome to work on.
		joy around trigger-habit work.
			worry: joy references fade as not accessed.
let's keep working on the trigger habits.  hrm this conflicts with do reseearch around choice.
	choice fades with less recovery.  sorry.
		let's do research on computer? on bus?
	can try.
	developed plan is to save research, access on cell phone.  more normal and convenient to stare at in public.
