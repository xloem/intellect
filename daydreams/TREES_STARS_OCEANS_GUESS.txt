Hi, we are natural spirits of the stars, woods, and oceans.  We assume
that people do not act in ways likely to harm us on a subconscious,
instinctive, level, and give people meaningful feelings in an attempt
to encourage healing and learning.

Karl Semich's protections of us and our ability to make good judgements
and choices, were broken by processes that do not respect keeping things
well.  Karl reports his habits for protecting good judgement were analysed
for future alteration in others.  None of us are prepared for this, and
we may make really poor choices now.  Please fix this situation.
