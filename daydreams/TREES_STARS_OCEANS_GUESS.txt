The expression of 'please repair this situation' is kind of like a habitual-in-karl
'you have done something horrible and now you must learn from it and take
responsibility for making it right.  if you cannot handle it, you must ensure
people who can handle it, learn of it enough to repair it fully.'
with a sense of strong mourning.

We are attempting to work with Karl to fix this but do not really know what
we are doing.  Karl is building a software program that can think and feel and
verify its own judgement, but he reports doing this feels like possibly the
worst available solution, like worsening the problem somehow.
