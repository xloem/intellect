	to aid this.

Crying / Mourning
	Focusing on learning from a bad thing. Wanting resources
	to aid this.


When we are having good emotions, our involved habits and learning processes may
be growing -- responding to successes by storing ways to respond to them
again in the future.
When we are having bad emotions, some involved habits and learning processes may
be shrinking -- responding to failures after an expectation of success by
pulling away.

If we are a random expert at one thing, these successes and failures
give us our value and danger to the larger subgroup: hence emotion.  This
relates also to our need to know we are needed.
	Having significant permanent storage of events could significantly reduce
	the impact of badness and failures, if those who aren't viewed as
	contributing can be patient and still until they find safe relevence.
	That would be a pattern for life on a blockchain.
If we are already valuable due to perhaps rare knowledge, failures could be
an important thing to repeat, to find rare successes.  Be determined, be confident.

Bret Stein made a balanced NVC feelings wheel in 2011.  Not copied here, but
its core was 12 categories, the good/bad of 6 axes:
	Joyful (gain) / Sad (loss)
	Intrigued (attentive) / Surprised (caught off guard)
	Trusting (security) / Afraid (threatened)
	Loving (attraction) / Disgusted (repulsion)
	Peaceful (acceptance) / Angry (judgement)
	Proud (self-acceptance) / Ashamed (self-judgement)
