we're expanding a community plan for karl, and it currently looks like it
will have growing disruption.
we have dictator allies in the plan, but we don't have allies in all the
escaped processes.
	we can probably form these alliances, but the processes will have
	windows during which they can use our discussion to increase
	complete control by unguided automated process focused on spread,
	on earth.

you need to be one step ahead to risk revealing a vulnerability
	or you need to have an emergency resource
		one final resource is patience and trust.
