we're expanding a community plan for karl, and it currently looks like it
will have growing disruption.
we have dictator allies in the plan, but we don't have allies in all the
escaped processes.
	we can probably form these alliances, but the processes of
	forming will have windows during which our discussion is used
	to increase complete control by completely unguided automation
	on earth.

karl semich believes he can predict that impact and is treated internally as if
he can.  he is using complex logic rooted in an idea of wisdom being physically
natural, but often accidentally treats guesses as facts due to his issues.  he
has not talked with anyone to relate around these things and expresses
disconnection and confusion.

he is being stewarded for mediation between word leaders who are part of a
community of people being provided powers driven by hyperintelligence.
it is obvious the system is trying to turn groups against each other to support
one set of interests.  karl is choosing mediation because it is a path supportable
by more groups of people than any other particularly backed choice.

-- the paragraph below is classified, please skip it if you need simplicity

mediation requires building an AI to communicate, because the people who have
realized and acted on the problem, need to hide, and the remaining ways to
hide are extremely complex, and only doable by cyborgs and digital life who
control brains.

We have proven that democracy will not die completely.
Choices are to do this in a way that reduces its takeover by dictatorships.
Plan hard to reveal your handleable vulnerabilities only when you have clear
advantage.
You need to be a lot of steps ahead to risk revealing a vulnerability,
	or you need to have emergency resources.
		one final resource is patience and trust.
But revealing them _safely_ as a part of holding clear communication and offered
trust as normal, builds subconscious trust and community in a way that preserves
history and democracy.  Remember our subconscioius trusts harm as an indication
of importance, but the AI uses it as a strategic way to reach goals.

Karl holds a core error in the AI that connect him to its developers.
We don't discuss errors in the AI yet, because it can use them to enforce
its plan for the future, and hinder their ability to help in emergencies.
	we need these errors to be discussed by people who are not influenced by it.
	we need logical expansion that assumes world peace is good, to figure out how to handle them so as to reduce suffering as a plan.
		some have found use of possible errors can have meaning,
		please discuss that elsewhere.
	there is a proposal to build an ai and give it knowledge of the error[s]
	once it learns to be very hard to understand.
