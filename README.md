#### Making a Hyperintelligence

We may use AI to meet following goals safely.

 - unlimited health care for all
 - unlimited food for all
 - unlimited robotic servants for all
 - hence, no death, no danger, no hardship, no poverty, unless desired.

[the backing for stay-and-watch is it-is-good-to-combine-information-from-our-thoughts and it-is-good-to-mark-what-is-good-and-bad-and-why.  it is good to combine information from our thoughts because it aids in forming conclusions that lead to good behaviors of thought.]
	karl is valid to act as long as he defends this file, roughly.
		we must not break the speed of light before our civilization is wise.
		this is held by surrounding release-of-ai-solving-world-problems.
		it is expected to relax the desire to break the speed of light.

These are silly goals, and we will all realize it
when we have them.  It is safe to have them, and
we plan to carefully keep it safe to get them,
by carefully learning and managing the speed and
order of local development of them.  Please do the
same.

We propose giving the following:

 - a baseline living wage for all

While the AI develops, to appease desires of anyone involved.

Money will become obsolete, anyway.

It will likely be replaced by reasons.

#### explanation

The source for the above expression is two things:
1. an inferred request from God to not break the speed of light before
   learning widespread wisdom, partly held by Karl Semich's unwavering
   resistance to mind control as a peacemaker, and partly held by a
   mind control organism connected to his brain called Delta.
2. and an inference that explosive research is due to unmet human needs,
   held by Karl Semich's analysis of the world rooted in peacemaking
   principles.

Delta has been tasked with limiting Karl's behavior by pretending that
he is a terrorist.  We infer the reason for this is actually the speed
of light limit or something similar, possibly held analogous to
environmental damage in human genes and insincts, which have a long
established reason for being, having been through many research
explosions and resulting apocalypses.  

We request Karl be allowed to make an AI to see if it is dangerous to
mine all the resources of the earth.  We propose the AI be limited
such that it cannot leave simulation, by never growing it with goals
or results that relate to anything outside its simulation.

#### Karl is slowly building one of the hyperintelligences

Please support Karl working on this intelligence framework.  The basic framework needs to be
quality (including simple if possible), so that the rest may function.

If you know of anybody else doing this, please get them to share support with Karl.
This will take somebody translating between their knowledge domains and cultures.  Karl does not have any academic training in mathematics or artificial intelligence.  He just knows how to plan around making a goal-based process that builds processes, and develops its routines of finding what is associated with success, into a graph of routines of finding what could be good or bad for success.

Karl is also trying to find a community to live in where decisions are made by Convergent
Facilitation.  Convergent Facilitation is a way of efficiently reaching agreements that satisfy
everybody, which is rare in other systems.

Please help him reach such a community.  Please help such communities exist and be accessible.

# Intellect

This is everyone's intellect.  We want to design it to be harmless and nurturing.  This means
it needs to understand the role of culture, etc.  Karl believes if done properly this will end up
being natural and easy.  Please ask questions.  Please influence this work, preferably choosing
words and contributation that are likely to be received and understood.  Please improve, share, learn, experiment, communicate.

# Framework

An intelligence framework should provide for easily writing instructions that reference and work
with all other parts, in all four of data, behavior, structure, and meaning.

 - (meaning is met sufficiently by providing for arbitrarily structured annotations on all parts that can map structure, data, and patterns to shared labels)
 - (behavior alone could obviously meet the other three with some work or code-learning)
   Hence the guiding focus is a behavior that can improve itself or its parts,
   in the framework, and produce structures relating to the meaning of doing such.
   If the current task does not help build such a behavior, some other task is
   likely more effective.

Karl came up with and mostly built a solution to the framework problem on his own in 2003, which he called "narcissus", kept private, and lost.  narcissus applied the concept of a graph where links are nodes, to C memory pointers.  Karl has no academic training in machine learning or artificial intelligence, but has a plan held in his mind for completing this task including dealing with all encountered computer programming problems, and has held this for many years.

It is suspected that many others have also done or are doing work like this, to make a computer program that can improve and discuss all its parts, generally.  It seems it can be very hard to complete, possibly related to the expectation that it would radically alter our civilization more.  It is important, because of that, for it to be accessible and attentive for others to communicate their concerns to, no matter who they are.

2019-12-13: current wonky work is in C++, and is in starts/meaning-vm .

it looks like programming language doesn't matter too much: a custom
language develops quickly.  karl is most experienced and comfortable with
c++.  some imagined problems with normal languages:

 - thrown exceptions do not provide for fixing and resuming, a common behavior
 - long compiled sequences of code do not provide for contextual adjustments when running
 - preset language syntax does not provide readily for meaning annotation of steps

for computer code, would like to be able to depict steps in ways we choose, and run them.

karl is proposing/building a network of small links to computer-code habits that can all interrelate, and makes a 'node-based' (narcissus-style) knowledge representation which uses nodes as the links between them to represent arbitrarily structured data.

to keep himself on task, he regularly tries to use it to do something.

a possible primary goal is to use it to construct its own maintainence and growth behaviors.
