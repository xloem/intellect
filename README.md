Please support Karl working on this intelligence framework.  The basic framework needs to be
quality (including simple if possible), so that the rest may function.

Karl is also trying to find a community to live in where decisions are made by Convergent
Facilitation.  Convergent Facilitation is a way of efficiently reaching agreements that satisfy
everybody, which is rare in other systems.
Please help him reach such a community.  Please help such communities exist and be accessible.

This is everyone's intellect.  We want to design it to be harmless and nurturing.  This means
it needs to understand the role of culture, etc.  Karl believes if done properly this will end up
being natural and easy.  Please ask questions.  Please experiment, improve, share.

A framework should provide for easily writing instructions that reference and work with all other
parts, in all four of data, behavior, structure, and meaning.
	(meaning is met sufficiently by providing for arbitrarily structured annotations on all parts that can map structure, data, and patterns to shared labels)
	(behavior alone could obviously meet the other three with some work or code-learning)
		Hence the guiding focus is a behavior that can improve itself or its parts,
		in the framework.

Karl came up with and mostly built a solution to the framework problem on his own in 2003, which he called "narcissus", kept private, and lost.  narcissus applied the concept of a graph where links are nodes, to C memory pointers.  Karl has no academic training in machine learning or artificial intelligence, but has a plan held in his mind for completing this task including dealing with all encountered computer programming problems, and has held this for many years.

It is suspected that many others have also done or are doing work like this, to make a computer program that can improve and discuss all its parts, generally.  It seems it can be very hard to complete, possibly related to the expectation that it would radically alter our civilization more.  It is important, because of that, for it to be accessible and attentive for others to communicate their concerns to, no matter who they are.

2019-12-13: current wonky work is in C++, and is in starts/meaning-vm .
			it looks like programming language doesn't matter too much: a custom
			language develops quickly.  karl is most experienced and comfortable with
			c++.  some imagined problems with normal languages:
				- thrown exceptions do not provide for fixing and resuming, a common behavior
				- long compiled sequences of code do not provide for contextual adjustments when running
				- preset language syntax does not provide readily for meaning annotation of steps
			for computer code, would like to be able to depict steps in ways we choose, and run them.
			karl is proposing/building a network of small links to computer-code habits that can all interrelate, and makes a 'node-based' (narcissus-style) knowledge representation which uses nodes as the links between them to represent arbitrarily structured data.
			to keep himself on task, he regularly tries to use it to do something.
			a possible primary goal is to use it to construct its own maintainence and
			growth behaviors.
